Section 1. Short Title and Purpose

This Implementing Rules and Regulations, hereinafter called the IRR, is issued
pursuant to Section 112 of Republic Act (RA) No. 12009, otherwise known as
the “New Government Procurement Act,” for the purpose of prescribing the
necessary rules and regulations for the procurement activities of the
Government of the Philippines (GoP), in accordance with the state policies and
principles declared under the Act.

This IRR is formulated to assist Procuring Entities in the conduct of
procurement planning up to contract implementation to facilitate government
procurement and delivery of public service.

Section 2. Declaration of Policy

The provisions of this IRR are in line with the commitment of the GoP to promote
the ideals of good governance with a view towards transparency,
competitiveness, efficiency, proportionality, accountability, public monitoring,
procurement professionalization, and sustainability in government
procurement.

The State aims to achieve value for money in government procurement to
ensure that public funds are utilized effectively and responsibly.

In case of doubt in the application, interpretation, and construction of any of the
provisions under RA No. 12009 and this IRR, the same shall be resolved in
favor of government procurement.

Section 3. Governing Principles on Government Procurement

Procurements by all branches and instrumentalities of the national government,
its departments, bureaus, offices, and agencies, including state universities and
colleges (SUCs), government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs),
government financial institutions (GFIs), and local government units (LGUs),
shall, in all cases, be governed by these principles:

       a) Transparency in the procurement process by providing access to all
          related information consistent with open contracting practices and
          standards that enable disclosure of data and facilitates information
          sharing related to all pertinent stages of procurement, as the case



                                                                                 1
         may be, to foster public trust by ensuring that all stakeholders have
         access to procurement information;

      b) Competitiveness by ensuring equal opportunity for all eligible and
         qualified suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, contractors,
         consultants, and service providers, whether public or private;

      c) Efficiency by implementing an organized, uniform, and
         straightforward procurement process through the use of emerging
         technologies and innovative solutions to attract a broader range of
         bidders and improve quality and cost-effectiveness in government
         procurement;

      d) Proportionality by ensuring that the conditions and parameters in the
         development of requirements, choice of procurement mode, and
         implementation of contracts shall be reasonably proportional to the
         needs and circumstances of the Procuring Entity, and the nature,
         scale and complexity of the project to be procured to ensure fair
         competition;

      e) Accountability where public officials and personnel take responsibility
         for their actions, decisions, and performance in the use of public
         resources and adhere to ethical standards. When warranted by
         circumstances, public officials and personnel directly or indirectly
         involved in the procurement process and in the implementation of
         contracts are investigated and held accountable for their actions, in
         accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations;

      f) Participatory procurement through public monitoring of the
         procurement process and the implementation of contracts to
         guarantee that every step is in accordance with the provisions of the
         Act and this IRR, and to ensure prudent and judicious use of
         government resources;

      g) Sustainability in the procurement process which covers the whole life
         cycle of a property, ensures value for money and maximum benefits
         to society and the economy, and engenders minimal impact to the
         environment; and

      h) Professionalism in procurement through the development of
         qualification standards and a competency and certification
         framework for procurement practitioners, and the adoption of a code
         of ethics that shall be observed by public procurement professionals.

        documents of the subcontractor will be required as part of the Bid or

         7.5.1.1 The subcontracted portion of the contract shall be subject to
                 the approval of the HoPE and the following conditions:

                 a) The subcontracted portion shall not exceed twenty percent
                    (20%) for Goods, and fifty percent (50%) for Infrastructure
                    Projects, or a different percentage on a per project basis
                    as approved by the GPPB. The threshold percentages

            the same eligibility documents as the general contractor.

             Failure of a subcontractor to meet the eligibility criteria does not
             affect the eligibility of the general contractor for the procurement
             project. In such case, the portion intended to be subcontracted to



                                                                              10
            the ineligible subcontractor shall be assumed by the general
            contractor;

    7.5.4   The general contractor shall remain liable for the subcontractor’s
            actions, defaults, delays, and negligence;

    7.5.5   The general contractor and the subcontractor are obliged to
            comply with the provisions of the contract and shall share liability,
            jointly and severally, in cases of violation of safety standards or
            other labor standards insofar as the subcontracted portion is
            concerned; and

    7.5.6   For the purpose of post-qualification in accordance with Section
            63 of this IRR, the value of the entire completed and accepted
            project, including the subcontracted portion, shall be recorded as
            experience of the general contractor. In the case of the
            subcontractor, the following rules shall apply:

         7.5.6.1   The subcontractor shall get credit for one hundred percent
                   (100%) of the value of the subcontracted portion of the

         7.5.6.2   Subcontractors shall be eligible to concessional windows
                   of GFIs that treat receivables from the government as loan
                   security; the receivables of subcontractors due from their
                   general contractor shall similarly be accepted as loan
                   security by GFIs; and

         7.5.6.3   Contract performance monitoring, such as the use of
                   Constructors Performance Evaluation System (CPES),
                   among others, shall also be mandatorily applied to the
                   work of subcontractors.

7.6 To assure the usefulness throughout the whole life cycle of goods to be
    procured, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that goods to be procured
    are brand new; Provided, That the procurement of second-hand,
    refurbished, or reconditioned goods, such as military, defense, or law
    enforcement equipment or materiel, may be considered to secure a
    contract that is most advantageous and offers value for money to the
    government, subject to the guidelines to be issued by the DBM and
    subject to compliance with relevant criteria, such as durability,
    remaining useful life, sustainability, maintenance cost, and warranty.

7.7 All procurement should be within the approved budget of the Procuring
    Entity.

Section 8.     Detailed Engineering for the Procurement of Infrastructure
               Projects

8.1 With the exception of an Infrastructure Project under a design-and-build
    scheme, no bidding and award of contract for Infrastructure Projects shall
    be made unless the detailed engineering investigations, surveys, and
    designs for the project which shall consider among others, the impact on
    the environment, have been sufficiently carried out and duly approved in
    accordance with the standards and specifications prescribed by the HoPE
    concerned or the duly authorized representative, pursuant to the
    recommendation of the End-User or Implementing Unit, and the
    acquisition of the required right-of-way for the project pursuant to R.A No.
    10752 has been accomplished.

       8.1.1 In case of projects with pending acquisition of right-of-way, site,
             or location, the procurement process may commence, but no
             award of contract shall be made until an authority or permit to
             enter is issued by the property owner; or a notarized deed of sale
             or deed of donation is executed in favor of the government; or a
             writ of possession is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,
             as the case may be.

8.2 Detailed engineering shall proceed only on the basis of the feasibility or
    preliminary engineering study made which establishes the technical
    viability of the project and conformance to land use and zoning guidelines
    prescribed by existing laws. The findings contained in the feasibility
    study, if undertaken for the project, shall be examined. If, in the course of
    this exercise, it is found that changes would be desirable in the design
    standards of principal features, as proposed, specific recommendations
    for such changes shall be supported by detailed justifications, including
    their effects on the cost, and the economic justification, if necessary.

      8.2.1 A schedule of detailed engineering activities shall include the
            following:

             a) Survey;

             b) Site Investigation;

             c) Soils and Foundation Investigation;

             d) Construction Materials Investigation;

           q) Preparation of report on asset climate hazards, risk
              assessment, disaster response strategies, and readiness
              planning.

8.3 Work under detailed architectural and engineering design shall include the
    following, among others:

   a) Design Standards which shall be in accordance with appropriate laws,
      rules, regulations, and accepted detailed engineering practices adopted
      by the Procuring Entity. Design standards for structures shall take into
      account, among others, geological hazards, seismicity of the area to
      determine the optimum safety of structures and to minimize possible
      earthquake damage, and the vulnerability of the area to natural
      disasters.

   b) Field Surveys and Investigations which may include aerial,
      geotechnical, hydrographic, topographic, hydrologic, sub-surface,
      remote-sensing, monumenting, and other surveys shall be carried out
      in accordance with the design guidelines, criteria, and standards
      adopted by the Procuring Entity. All survey and investigation works shall
      be prepared in a manner satisfactory to carry out accurate design and
      production of plans that will permit quantity estimates to be made within
      plus or minus ten percent (+/-10%) of the final quantities of the
      completed structure. Survey must follow standards set by relevant
      government agencies.



                                                                             15
c) Contract Plans shall be prepared for each construction contract in
   accordance with guidelines and standards adopted by the Procuring
   Entity, incorporating at least the following:

      i) Site development plan;

      ii) Plans and profile sheet;

      iii) Typical Sections and details;

      iv) Drainage details where applicable;

      v) Structural plans at appropriate scales indicating all details
      necessary in order that the complete structure can be set out and
      constructed; and

      vi) Other details which may be required by the HoPE.

d) All construction quantities shall be computed to a reasonable accuracy
   of not more than plus or minus ten percent (+/-10%) of the final
   quantities of the as-built structure.

e) Special Provisions shall be prepared to cover specifications for terms of
   work or methods of construction, measurement and payment under
   each contract which are not covered by Standard Construction and
   Material Specifications adopted by the Procuring Entity.

f) Unit Prices shall be prepared for each contract using costs based on
   reasonable approved current prices as projected over the proposed
   construction period, divided into local and foreign exchange costs, as
   the case may be.

g) ABC as determined in accordance with this IRR.

h) Bidding Documents prepared in accordance with this IRR.

i) Before implementing any project, the necessary Scope of Work shall be
   prepared and submitted for approval. In no case shall construction
   funds be remitted to field offices nor construction work on a project be
   started before the Scope of Work is approved, in accordance with
   existing laws.

   No Scope of Work for any project shall be approved without detailed
   architectural and engineering design. The Scope of Work shall include,
   among others, estimates of the work, items, quantities, and costs and a
   Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and Critical Path
   Method (CPM), Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) or any other
   project management tool to monitor and supervise the project activities.
   The Scope of Work shall cover at least a usable portion of the project,
   and no construction shall be started for portions of the project that are


                                                                          16
      less than usable, except projects requiring stage construction, in which
      case continuity of construction up to the completion of a usable portion
      must be assured.

   j) In the preparation of the Bidding Documents, the Procuring Entity shall
      make an estimate of the actual number of working days required to
      complete the project through PERT and CPM or PDM analysis of the
      project activities and corrected for holidays and weekends. Likewise,
      the Procuring Entity shall make an estimate of the number of rainy or
      unworkable days considered unfavorable for the prosecution of the
      works at the site, based on the records of the Philippine Atmospheric,
      Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, and
      incorporate the same in the corrected actual number of working days
      determined above, which shall be made the basis of the total contract
      time. The estimated number of rainy or unworkable days considered
      unfavorable for the prosecution of the works at the site shall be made
      known before the date of bidding, when available, through the
      Instructions to Bidders for the purpose of guiding the contractor in
      preparing its bid and as reference to both the GoP and winning
      contractors taking action on the requests for time extensions. Without
      the estimated number of rainy or unworkable days established before
      the bidding date and made known to all participating bidders, the
      contract time is presumed to have excluded the unfavorable conditions.

   k) The warranty period, as required by the Procuring Entity for the type of
      project, shall be specified in the Bidding Documents.

   l) For major projects, as specified by the Procuring Entity, value
      engineering shall be conducted according to accepted standards and
      practices. Value engineering shall analyze alternative schemes of
      achieving the project objectives to delete or reduce non-essential
      features and lessen the life cycle costs of the projects without sacrificing
      the quality and integrity of the structure while maintaining its essential
      function, performance, and safety.

   m) Site or Right-of-Way Acquisition Plans and Resettlement Action Plans
      shall be prepared based on parcellary surveys and socio-economic
      surveys of households affected by the project.

8.4 Since the contracts are fixed price contracts, the ABC to be bid shall
    provide for the projected movements of construction costs over the
    construction period considering the projected inflation and foreign
    exchange rates as approved by the Development Budget Coordination
    Committee. It shall also show the local and foreign currency requirements,
    as the case may be.

8.5 For projects to be implemented in phases, the Procuring Entity shall
    ensure that there is a clear delineation of work for each phase, which must
    be usable and structurally sound. It shall also ensure the conduct of the
    detailed engineering activities for each phase, as provided by this IRR.


                                                                                17
8.6 As a requirement for the procurement of Infrastructure Projects, the
    concerned End-User or Implementing Unit or consultants who prepared
    and approved, as the case may be, the detailed architecture and
    engineering design shall issue a certification that the detailed architecture
    and engineering surveys and designs have been conducted according to
    the prescribed agency standards and specifications in conformance with
    the provisions of this IRR and that the detailed architecture and
    engineering design outputs are adequate for the procurement at hand. The
    approval by the authorized government officials of the detailed architecture
    and engineering surveys and designs undertaken by the End-user or
    Implementing Unit or consultants neither diminishes the responsibility of
    the latter for the technical integrity of the surveys and designs nor transfers
    any part of that responsibility to the approving officials.

8.7 The above rules shall apply to the implementation of Infrastructure
    Projects under normal or ordinary conditions. However, under emergency
    or extraordinary cases involving calamities and disaster as declared by the
    President or as may be issued by the local Sanggunian upon the
    recommendation of the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management
    Office, where time is of the essence to save lives and properties, and
    restore damaged Infrastructure, detailed engineering works shall be
    conducted in accordance with the guidelines and procedures, as
    prescribed by the head of the appropriate infrastructure agency, as the
    case maybe, to enable a quick response to said cases, while maintaining
    the safety and integrity of the structure.

8.8 Procuring Entities may consider an architectural design that is well-curated
    and aesthetically pleasing to ensure that the Infrastructure Project not only
    meets functional requirements but also contributes to its overall appeal
    and architectural integrity.

Section 9. Multi-Year Contracting

9.1 The issuance of a MYCA or similar documents shall be required before
    Procuring Entities commence any procurement activity covering locally-
    funded multi-year contracts, subject to the guidelines issued by the DBM.

     The MYCA is issued by the DBM for multi-year locally-funded projects in
     order to authorize the Procuring Entity to enter into multi-year contracts.

     The total project cost reflected in the MYCA or its equivalent document
     shall be the basis or reference for the ABC of the procurement contract.

        9.1.1 NGAs including SUCs, GOCCs, and GFIs shall secure a MYCA
              from the DBM prior to the commencement of any procurement
              activity for multi-year projects which are fully funded under the
              GAA.




                                                                                 18
        9.1.2 SUCs, GOCCs and GFIs implementing multi-year projects
              which are partially funded from both their internally generated
              income and the GAA shall secure prior authority from their
              respective governing boards and MYCA from the DBM, in such
              amounts proportionate to the funding provision from each
              source, before commencing procurement activities.

        9.1.3 SUCs, GOCCs and GFIs implementing multi-year projects
              which are fully funded by their internally generated income shall
              secure prior authority from their respective governing boards
              before commencing procurement activities.

        9.1.4 LGUs shall secure any equivalent document issued by their
              respective Sanggunian authorizing them to enter into multi-year
              contracts, as may be applicable.

Section 10. Market Scoping

10.1 To ensure proper and strategic procurement planning, the Procuring
     Entity, through the End-User or Implementing Unit, shall conduct market
     scoping as a preliminary undertaking in preparing its PPMP, which covers
     the proper cost estimation, project design and specifications, technical
     and selection criteria, delivery lead time, storage or warehousing
     requirements, related industry practices, and other relevant market
     information.

      e) Price sourcing for quotations or cost estimates from suppliers,
         contractors, or consultants to determine appropriate costs and the
         relevant factors and conditions affecting towards of the ABC;

      f) Use of relevant data from the PhilGEPS or agency websites to serve
         as a guide or reference; or


                                                                             19
      g) Any analogous activity for the purpose of gathering relevant market
         information.

10.3 Market Scoping is a preliminary process wherein the Procuring Entity
     collects relevant market information to understand the supply
     environment, identify potential suppliers, evaluate available products or
     services, and assess relevant market trends in order to develop a
     comprehensive and realistic PPMP, and to ensure that the Procuring
     Entity clearly understands the market conditions, supplier capabilities,
     pricing trends, and any potential risks that may affect procurement
     decisions.

     The conduct of Market Scoping shall observe the principle of
     Proportionality.

10.4 To guarantee proper and strategic procurement planning, the Procuring
     Entity shall conduct market scoping as a preliminary undertaking in
     preparing its PPMP, which covers the following:

     10.4.1 Proper cost estimates involve factors, such as direct and indirect
            costs, contingencies, and other associated costs, while factoring
            in cost trends, inflation, life cycle cost, and procurement modes.

     10.4.2 Project Design and Specifications, in relation to Section 11 of this
            IRR, must align with relevant characteristics, performance or
            functionality requirements, or product or service standards
            specified by appropriate government entities or similar
            international bodies. Industry standards and best practices may
            be considered to ensure compatibility with market capabilities,
            including environmental and climate risk factors, to address the
            needs of the Procuring Entity.

     10.4.3 Technical criteria for evaluating the bids based on performance,
            safety, quality, expertise, financial stability, and past
            performance. It may also include scoring for climate resilience
            and environmental performance.

     10.4.4 Delivery lead time involves assessing supply chain, market
            availability and capability, including logistics systems to ensure
            timely delivery and readiness to meet the specific needs and
            requirements of the Procuring Entity.

     10.4.5 Storage or warehousing requirements, in relation to Section 19 of
             this IRR, involve identifying the specific needs of the Procuring
             Entity, market options for warehousing, logistics and security,
             while considering specific conditions like temperature, humidity,
             and handling needs.




                                                                              20

     technical compatibility, interoperability, servicing, maintenance, or
     preservation of supplier warranty in order to keep the performance,
     functionality, and useful life of the equipment, in which case, the
     Procuring Entity shall indicate the reasons or justifications for availing of
     the exception as part of the Technical Specifications, Scope of Work, or
     Terms of Reference, as the case may be.

Section 12. Early Procurement Activities

12.1 For Goods to be delivered, Infrastructure Projects to be implemented, and
     Consulting Services to be rendered in the following fiscal year, Procuring
     Entities are authorized to undertake EPA, short of award, as soon as the
     NEP, Local Expenditure Program, or proposed Corporate Operating
     Budget is submitted to the Congress, Sanggunian, or Governing Board,
     respectively, pending the approval of the funding thereof under the GAA,
     corporate operating budget, appropriation ordinance or loan agreements
     in the case of Foreign-Assisted Projects (FAPs), as the case may be,
     subject to guidelines issued for the purpose.

12.2 The conduct of EPA shall be made only upon approval of the Indicative
     APP by the HoPE, and subject to the guidelines issued by the GPPB.

12.3 For EPA, the ABC shall not exceed the amount specified in the approved

12.4 No award of contract shall be made until the approval and effectivity of
     the appropriate funding, under the GAA, corporate operating budget,
     appropriation ordinance, or loan agreement, as the case may be. The
     HoPE shall also approve the final APP before the award of the contract
     is made.



                                                                                21
12.5 In case of projects requiring acquisition of right-of-way, no award of
     contract shall likewise be made until an authority or permit to enter is
     issued by the property owner; or a notarized deed of sale or deed of
     donation is executed in favor of the government; or a writ of possession
     is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be.

Section 13. Life cycle Assessment and Life cycle Cost Analysis

13.1 To further support strategic procurement management and ensure smart
     and prudent use of government resources, Procuring Entities shall apply
     Life cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA), as
     may be applicable, in project planning, eligibility and selection criteria, or
     contract implementation; Provided, That the implementation of the LCCA
     and LCA shall be subject to the guidelines issued by the GPPB.

13.2 Procuring Entities shall apply LCA to evaluate the potential environmental
     and social impacts of Goods, including the goods component of
     Infrastructure Projects, or Consulting Services throughout their entire life
     cycle, from raw material extraction and manufacturing to transportation,
     usage, and disposal. Procuring Entities shall use LCA to:

       a) Assess the potential environmental and social impacts of Goods;

       b) Prioritize the most significant risks and opportunities for mitigation;

       c) The Bid evaluation phase to determine the winning bidder; and

       d) Establish criteria for comparing potential market solutions.

 13.3 Procuring Entities shall apply LCCA to calculate the total cost of
      acquisition, operation, maintenance, disposal, and to identify the
      evaluation criteria of the project or asset to enable Procuring Entities to
      determine long-term financial implications of their procurement projects,
      allowing them to select the most cost-effective approach that results in
      savings and financial sustainability of projects. The Procuring Entities
      shall apply the LCCA to:

           a) The procurement planning phase to evaluate different market
              solutions to meet the procurement need and calculate the
              budget proposal;

           b) The bid evaluation phase to determine the winning bidder; and

           c) The contract implementation phase to monitor the compliance
              of suppliers with environmental requirements prescribed in the
              contract.

 13.4 Procuring Entities shall set a transparent methodology that outlines the
      data needed and calculation methodology to be used when conducting
      an LCCA or LCA, as may be applicable, for Goods, including the goods


                                                                                 22
      component of Infrastructure Projects, or Consulting Services, to ensure
      comparability and fairness among bidders, with due consideration on
      the significance of the potential environmental impacts, bidder’s ability
      to provide the information requested for bid evaluation and feasibility of
      verifying compliance during contract implementation.

 13.5 Procuring Entities shall primarily be guided by the principle of
      proportionality and the Fit-for-Purpose approach when deciding
      whether to apply LCA and LCCA to a specific procurement project.

 13.6 The GPPB shall issue detailed guidelines and tools on the application
      of LCA and LCCA to ensure consistency across government
      procurement activities.

Section 14. Design-and-Build Scheme for Infrastructure Projects

  14.1 In preparing for a procurement project, Procuring Entities may consider
        employing the design-and-build scheme as a procurement approach
        whereby a single contractor is responsible for both design and
        construction of the government building or Infrastructure, which allows
        quality assurance, effective cost and schedule management, and
        improved energy efficiency and environmental impact.

        The Procuring Entity shall provide a mechanism to assess the
        suitability of the design-and-build scheme; ensure the proper
        preparation of the conceptual design, performance specifications and
        parameters; conduct review of detailed architectural and engineering
        design; and undertake oversight and monitoring of project planning
        and contract implementation.

Section 15. Engagement of a Procurement Agent

15.1 As part of strategic procurement planning, the HoPE may authorize the
     engagement of a government Procurement Agent, which shall undertake
     the functions of the BAC, if the Procuring Entity does not have the
     capability or proficiency to undertake a particular procurement; Provided,
     That the Procuring Entity cannot delegate the issuance of the Notice of
     Award and the award of contract to the Procurement Agent; and there
     shall be no transfer of funds to the Procurement Agent, except for the
     payment of service fee for services rendered as Procurement Agent, if
     applicable.

15.2 The engagement of a Procurement Agent shall be further subject to the
     following mandatory conditions:

      a) The engagement shall be made on a per project basis;

      b) The engagement shall be limited to procurement undertaken
         through Competitive Bidding; Provided, That in instances where the
         Procuring Entity lacks sufficient qualified personnel to constitute its


                                                                              23
          own BAC, the Procuring Entity may engage a Procurement Agent to
          undertake other modes of procurement;

      c) The Procurement Agent should be another government agency
         expert in the field which is the subject of procurement. This shall be
         expressly provided in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with
         the Procuring Entity.

          For purposes of the foregoing requirement, the government agency
          shall be deemed as an expert if: (i) it has successfully awarded at
          least two (2) similar contracts, each valued at no less than fifty
          percent (50%) of the ABC of the current procurement project, or (ii)
          if the subject matter of the procurement is directly related to the core
          mandate of the Procurement Agent;

      d) At least one (1) representative from the Procuring Entity shall be
         designated as a member of the TWG of the Procurement Agent to
         ensure that the technical specifications or terms of reference of the
         Procuring Entity are properly reflected in the bidding documents;

      e) A representative from the Procuring Entity shall be designated as a
         provisional member of the BAC of the Procurement Agent;

      f) The engagement shall be covered by a MOA that is executed
         between the Procuring Entity and the Procurement Agent, providing
         the details of the project to be procured; the accountabilities and
         obligations of the two (2) parties; the ABC; services fees, if
         applicable; and such other details as may be necessary.

          The MOA shall be executed and become effective within six (6)
          months before the end of the validity of the relevant appropriations
          as authorized in the applicable appropriations law, or in the
          corporate operating budgets or appropriations ordinances, in the
          case of GOCCs, GFIs, and LGUs, respectively. In no case shall the
          undertakings of the MOA contravene the provisions of this Section;
          and

      g) The Procurement Agent shall not transfer, delegate, or assign, in
         whole or in part, the performance of its obligations to any other
         entity.

15.3 Procuring Entities with existing MOAs or contracts entered into prior to
     the effectivity of RA No. 12009 and this IRR shall remain valid, subject
     to the provisions of this Section.

Section 16. Use of Framework Agreement

16.1 Procuring Entities may use a Framework Agreement as a procurement
     strategy to expand the pool of prospective bidders, take advantage of



                                                                                24
     economies of scale, minimize the administrative burden of conducting
     separate procurement activities, and generate time and money savings.

16.2 The Framework Agreement shall be in the nature of an option contract
     between the Procuring Entity and the bidder that stipulates the terms and
     conditions to be applied in subsequent contracts for the procurement of
     Goods, Infrastructure Projects, and Consulting Services with a single or
     multiple contractor, manufacturer, supplier, distributor, consultant, and
     service provider, subject to the guidelines to be issued by the GPPB.

Section 17. Pooled Procurement

     performance or functionality requirements, including the award criterion
     during the second stage of the bidding process, in the Invitation to Bid or
     Request for Expression of Interest.

29.4 Competitive Dialogue has two distinct stages:

     29.4.1 The first stage where the eligibility requirements and initial
            technical proposals of interested suppliers, contractors, or
            consultants are evaluated, followed by the dialogue proper. The
            first stage shall involve the following activities:

             a) Prospective bidders shall submit their initial technical
                proposals, as well as their legal, technical, and financial
                eligibility requirements, within the deadline prescribed in the
                Bidding Documents not exceeding the following maximum
                periods counted from the last day of posting of the Invitation
                to Bid or Request for Expression of Interest:

                    i) For Goods, forty-five (45) calendar days.

                    ii) For Infrastructure Projects, sixty-five (65) calendar
                        days.

                    iii) For Consulting Services, seventy-five (75) calendar
                         days.

                 The BAC shall first determine the eligibility of the prospective
                 bidders in accordance with Section 52 of this IRR, and the
                 initial technical proposals shall be evaluated using a “pass or
                 fail” criterion to determine whether the same meet the
                 minimum technical requirements of the Procuring Entity.
                 Eligible bidders whose technical proposals meet the required
                 minimum standards shall then be invited to participate in the
                 dialogue.

             b) For the procurement of Consulting Services, the short-listing
                procedure under Section 53 of this IRR shall be conducted
                during the first stage as described in the preceding
                paragraph.

             c) The BAC shall conduct a dialogue, either jointly or separately
                among participants to determine, identify, describe, define,
                and finalize the technical components and specifications of
                the project, Scope of Work, design, value engineering, Terms
                of Reference, key personnel, manpower requirements and
                appropriate expertise, including sustainability aspects in the
                procurement of Goods, Infrastructure, and Consulting
                Services.



                                                                               41
             d) The dialogue may include contract terms and conditions,
                particularly payment terms and advance payment, delivery
                instructions, warranties, and inspection and testing.

             e) The BAC shall ensure that all bidders participating in the
                dialogue are treated equally and fairly, and it shall not provide
                information in a manner which may discriminate, give undue
                advantage to, or otherwise favor some participating bidders
                over others. The BAC shall not reveal or disclose any
                confidential information received during the course of the
                dialogue to any participating bidder unless with the express
                consent of the owner of the confidential information. Such
                consent or agreement to disclose confidential information
                shall be limited to the communication of specific information
                and shall not take the form of a general waiver.

      29.4.2 The second stage where the final technical and financial
             proposals of the remaining participants are submitted and
             evaluated under a competitive bidding procedure using Lowest
             Calculated Responsive Bid (LCRB), Most Economically
             Advantageous Responsive Bid (MEARB), Most Advantageous
             Responsive Bid (MARB) or Highest Rated Responsive Bid
             (HRRB). The second stage shall involve the following activities:

              a) Within ten (10) calendar days from finalization of the
                 Technical Specifications, Scope of Work or Terms of
                 Reference, as the case may be, under the first stage, copies
                 of the same, as well as the criteria for qualitative rating if
                 applicable, shall be issued to all bidders that participated in
                 the dialogue; and

              b) Bidders shall submit their revised technical proposals as well
                 as their financial proposals in two (2) separate sealed
                 envelopes within a period not exceeding twenty (20) calendar
                 days from issuance of the finalized Technical Specifications,
                 Scope of Work, or Terms of Reference, as the case may be.
                 The contract shall be awarded to the bidder declared as the
                 LCRB, MEARB, MARB or HRRB, following the applicable bid
                 evaluation and post-qualification procedures under Sections
                 61, 62, and 63 of this IRR.

              efficiency, cost, or outcome.

      b) The Procuring Entity has invited comparative or competitive bids
         which refer to offers submitted by the bidders through Competitive
         Bidding in response to a call for offers by way of Invitation to Bid or
         Request for Expression of Interest.

30.2 For the unsolicited offer to be considered for evaluation by the Procuring
     Entity, the manufacturer, distributor, supplier, or consultant shall submit
     the following:

      a) Details of the new concept or technology which shall contain the
         following information:

          i) A basic description of the new concept or technology in
             compliance with sub-section 30.1(a), including but not limited to
             its purpose, unique features, and potential applications;

          ii) The expected output or outcome, clearly demonstrating the

      b) Proof of concept, or equivalent document or sample to validate the
         feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed technology or solution.


                                                                               43

     twenty (20) day period that it shall conduct the evaluation of the offer
     upon the submission of complete documentary requirements pursuant to
     Section 30.2 within thirty (30) calendar days from notice. Resubmission
     due to lacking requirements shall be considered as a new submission,
     subject to the first in time, stronger in right approach, as provided in the
     succeeding sub-section.

     The offer shall be deemed rejected if the Procuring Entity did not act on
     the offer within the ten (10)-day period, or if the offeror failed to submit
     complete documentary requirements within the thirty-day period as
     prescribed in the preceding paragraph.

     The offeror may still withdraw its unsolicited offer within five (5) calendar
     days from receipt of the notice from the Procuring Entity. If the offer is
     withdrawn after such period, the offeror shall not be allowed to participate
     in any procurement opportunity of the Procuring Entity for a period of one

30.4 In case the Procuring Entity receives more than one unsolicited offer with
      complete documentary requirements involving the same or similar new
      concept or technology, the first in time, stronger in right approach shall
      be applied in determining the original offeror. All other offers shall be
      rejected without prejudice to the participation by the other offerors in the
      competitive bidding under this mode.

30.5 The Procuring Entity, through the End-User or Implementing Unit, shall
     conduct an evaluation of the submitted requirements to determine if the
     project being offered involves a new concept or technology in accordance
     with Section 30.1(a). The Procuring Entity shall complete the entire
     evaluation process within sixty (60) calendar days, unless extended by
     the HoPE for justifiable reasons not exceeding thirty (30) calendar days.



                                                                                44
     During the evaluation process, the Procuring Entity shall likewise verify,
     validate, and ascertain the legal, technical, and financial eligibility of the
     offeror; and determine if funds are available to meet the offer, subject to
     budgeting, accounting, and auditing laws, rules, and regulations.

     The Procuring Entity shall notify the offeror of the results of the
     evaluation. In case of favorable evaluation results, the Procuring Entity
     shall inform the offeror in the same notice that negotiation shall
     commence at a specified date within five (5) calendar days from receipt
     of notice.

30.6 The Procuring Entity shall negotiate with the offeror on the project scope,
     price, implementation arrangements, and the terms and conditions of the
     ensuing contract, among others, and discuss budget availability and
     related issues, if any. The Procuring Entity shall complete the negotiation
     with the offeror within fifteen (15) calendar days from the commencement
     thereof.

     If the negotiation is unsuccessful, the Procuring Entity shall declare a
     failure of negotiation, resulting in the termination of the procurement
     activity.

     If the negotiation is successful, the Procuring Entity shall issue a
     certification conferring original offeror status to the offeror. Such status
     confirms the offeror’s responsiveness to the legal, technical, and financial
     requirements of the proposed project. The offeror shall submit the
     appropriate bid security pursuant to Section 56 of this IRR within ten (10)
     calendar days from receipt of the certification conferring original offeror
     status.

     After appropriate funds are secured for the purpose, the Procuring Entity
     shall ensure that the particular Goods or Consulting Services are
     included in the APP.

30.7 Within thirty (30) calendar days from the conferment of the original offeror
     status, the Procuring Entity shall publish an Invitation to Bid for
     comparative or competitive bids against the negotiated original offer. The
     comparative or competitive bids shall be composed of the technical
     proposal that complies with the technical specifications or terms of
     reference of the negotiated original offer, and the financial proposal. The
     comparative or competitive bid that complies with the technical
     component of the negotiated original offer and with the lowest price
     proposal shall be declared as the Lowest Comparative or Competitive
     Bid (LCCB), subject to post-qualification pursuant to Section 63 of this
     IRR. If the LCCB passes all the criteria for post-qualification, it shall be
     declared as the Lowest Comparative or Competitive Responsive Bid
     (LCCRB).




                                                                                 45
30.8 Within fifteen (15) calendar days from determination of the LCCRB, the
     original offeror may match the offer of the LCCRB or submit a lower price
     proposal.

     The contract shall be awarded to the original offeror if:

        a) No comparative or competitive bid is received within the period
           prescribed in the IRR;

        b) The bids submitted by the comparative offerors failed at bid
           opening; or

        c) The original offeror matched or submits a lower price proposal
           against the comparative or competitive bid.

     In case the original offeror is unable to match the offer of the LCCRB or
     submit a lower price proposal, the contract shall be awarded to the bidder
     with the LCCRB.

     in the case of Competitive Bidding, Limited Source Bidding or
     Competitive Dialogue for the second time, as provided in Section 64 of

           the BAC, based on its findings, as assisted by its
           Secretariat, TWG and End-User or Implementing Unit may
           revise and agree on the technical, legal, and financial
           eligibility requirements and technical specifications or terms
           of reference, and if necessary, adjust the ABC, subject to
           the required approvals. However, the ABC cannot be
           increased by more than twenty percent (20%) of the ABC
           for the last failed bidding. In case no revision of the eligibility
           document covered by Section 52 of this IRR is found
           necessary by the BAC after the conduct of the mandatory
           review, the submission of the PhilGEPS Certificate of

           competition. This, notwithstanding, those who responded
           through any of the required postings shall be allowed to
           participate. Even if only one (1) bidder responds to such
           invitation or posting, the BAC shall proceed with the
           negotiation subject to the rules prescribed hereunder;

        c) Any requirements, guidelines, documents, clarifications, or
           other information relative to the negotiations that are
           communicated by the BAC to a supplier, contractor, or
           consultant shall be communicated on an equal basis to all
           other suppliers, contractors, or consultants engaging in
           negotiations with the BAC relative to the procurement. The
           prospective bidders shall be given equal time and
           opportunity to negotiate and discuss the technical and
           financial requirements of the project to be able to submit a
           responsive quotation or proposal;

         d) Following completion of the negotiations, the BAC shall
            request all suppliers, contractors, or consultants in the
            proceedings to submit, on a specified date, a best offer
            based on the final technical and financial requirements; and

        e) The BAC shall recommend the award of contract to the

           Goods and Infrastructure Projects or Single or Highest
           Rated and Responsive Proposal (S/HRRP) for Consulting


                                                                            51

35.9 Lease of Real Property and Venue. For the lease of real property
    and venue for official use, it is preferred that government agencies
    lease publicly owned real property or venue from other government
    agencies. If there is an available publicly owned real property or
    venue that complies with the requirements of the Procuring Entity,
    it may enter into a contract of lease with the government agency
    owner. In the event that the Procuring Entity would resort to privately
    owned real property or venue, the End-User or Implementing Unit
    shall justify that the same is more efficient and economical to the
    government.

    For purposes of this type of negotiated procurement, the following
    terms are defined as:

     a) Real Property refers to land and buildings (office spaces or
        units) and constructions of all kinds attached to the land or
        ground.

     b) Venue refers to training centers, convention halls, hotels, and
        similar establishments catering to trainings, seminars,
        conferences, conventions, symposia and similar gatherings
        requiring the official participation of government officials and
        employees. This may include meals and accommodation
        depending on the requirements of the Procuring Entity.

     c) Lessee refers to any government agency temporarily
        occupying real property on the basis of a contract executed
        with the private individual, partnership, cooperative,



                                                                         59
      association, or corporation having absolute ownership over or
      legal authority to lease out the subject real property or venue.

  d) Lessor refers to any government agency or private individual,
     partnership, cooperative, association, or corporation having
     absolute ownership over or legal authority to lease out the
     subject real property or venue.

35.9.1 Under this mode, the following conditions must be present:

    a) The location of the real property or venue to be leased should
       have been meticulously selected by the Procuring Entity after
       taking consideration, among others, the need for prudence
       and economy in government service and the suitability of the
       area in relation to the mandate of the office, and its
       accessibility to its stakeholders. For lease of venue, other
       factors, such as the nature of the event or the level of security
       in the proposed location, may also be taken into account.

    b) The ABC shall be supported by a canvass, based on either
       the average or the midpoint of the prevailing lease rates for
       real property or venue, from at least three (3) lessors within
       the vicinity of the selected location complying with the
       minimum criteria and technical requirements of the End-User
       or Implementing Unit. In no case shall the rental rates,
       including additional expenses, such as but not limited to
       association dues in the case of lease of real property, exceed
       the ABC.

    c) As a general rule, rental rates are considered reasonable
       when they represent or approximate the value of what the
       lessee gets in terms of accommodation, facility, amenities,
       and convenience from the leased real property or venue, and
       the lessor gets an equitable return of capital or investment.

    d) The technical requirements shall be prepared by the End-
       User or Implementing Unit taking into consideration the rating
       factors to be issued by the GPPB.

    e) Pursuant to Annex “E” of COA Circular No. 2012-003 and
       subject to subsequent issuances, lease of expensive or
       luxury venues for meetings or seminars and other official
       functions shall not be allowed, unless for government-

           venues within the vicinity of the selected location.
           Receipt of at least one (1) quotation is sufficient to
           proceed with the evaluation thereof.




                                                                 61

              d) The Procuring Entity shall require the submission of a
                 warranty security based on the End-User or Implementing

          Negotiated Procurement of Goods, Infrastructure Projects or
          Consulting Services with utmost necessity and justification;

       b) The GPPB shall have findings that any of the existing modes of
          procurement will be impossible or defeats the purpose of the
          procurement;

       c) The Goods, Infrastructure Projects or Consulting Services are better
          identified by the Procuring Entity on its distinctiveness and
          uniqueness to a procurement program, activity or project; and

       d) Other circumstances that may be identified by the GPPB which
          justify the addition of a new type of Negotiated Procurement that will
          address the concerns of one or more government agencies.

Section 36. Direct Sales

36.1   Direct Sales is a mode of procurement of Non-CSE where a Procuring
       Entity directly purchases from a supplier that has satisfactorily delivered
       Non-CSE to another government agency under a completed contract.

       Direct Sales may only be resorted to when all of the following conditions
       are met:

          a) The procurement project is included in the approved APP of the
             Procuring Entity;

          b) The original Non-CSE was procured and awarded through
             Competitive Bidding, Limited Source Bidding, Competitive
             Dialogue or Unsolicited Offer with Bid Matching;




                                                                                68
          c) The government agency that originally procured the Non-CSE
             has inspected and accepted the same, and has issued a
             certification that the supplier has satisfactorily performed its
             obligations under the contract;

          d) The procurement for the same Non-CSE by the Procuring Entity
             shall only be initiated once within six (6) months from the
             acceptance of the Non-CSE by the original government agency;

          e) The contract to be executed between the Procuring Entity and
             the supplier must be within the amount of the contract executed
             with the original government agency, and that the supplier must
             offer the Non-CSE to the Procuring Entity at the same or lower
             unit price offered to the original government agency; and

          f) The supplier agreed to the terms offered by the Procuring Entity
             and remains legally, technically, and financially capable to
             undertake the contract with the Procuring Entity.

36.2   Under this mode of procurement, the following procedure shall be
       observed:

          a) The original government agency, when requested by the
             Procuring Entity, shall provide a copy of the original procurement
             documents and papers, such as but not limited to, the actual
             Bidding Documents, Notice of Award, signed contract or
             Purchase Order, Notice to Proceed, Inspection and Acceptance
             Report, Certificate of Satisfactory Performance and Completion,
             and other relevant documents;

          b) The End-User or Implementing Unit shall carefully review the
             procurement documents obtained from the original government
             agency, and prepare the necessary Purchase Request for the
             procurement of the goods;

          c) Direct Sales Request (DSR) shall be issued by the Procuring
             Entity to the supplier. In the event of acceptance by the supplier,
             the same shall be made in writing and communicated to the
             Procuring Entity within five (5) calendar days from receipt of the
             request. The acceptance shall contain a statement of compliance
             with the technical requirements stated in the DSR, computation
             of the NFCC, and the supplier’s offer which must be the same or
             lower unit price as in the original contract, and accompanied by
             a copy of its valid and updated PhilGEPS Certificate of
             Registration (Platinum Membership); otherwise, the supplier
             shall notify the Procuring Entity in writing of its non-acceptance
             of the request within the same period; and

          d) When all the conditions are present, the BAC of the Procuring
             Entity shall recommend to the HoPE the award of contract


                                                                              69
             through Direct Sales to the supplier. The award of contract shall
             be made in accordance with Section 66 of this IRR.

Section 37. Direct Procurement for Science, Technology, and Innovation

37.1 Direct Procurement for Science, Technology and Innovation is a mode
     of procurement where the Procuring Entity may procure the following
     goods and services directly from a legally, technically, and financially
     capable manufacturer or supplier, or from a qualified startup business:

      a) Supplies, materials, equipment, and related services to be used
         actually, exclusively, and directly in the conduct of research and
         development projects or activities;

      b) Goods which include products of a commissioned task by a
         Procuring Entity which were processed, developed, and
         manufactured in satisfaction of its needs and requirements. These
         include: (i) pre-commercial goods and services that involve early
         market engagement to stimulate the development of new goods and
         services that meet specific government needs; and (ii) goods to be
         manufactured by qualified startup businesses alongside the thrust
         to develop and support new and startup businesses.

         Unless otherwise indicated in a written agreement, the intellectual
         property rights and ownership over the commissioned goods
         developed and manufactured pursuant to this provision shall belong
         to the Procuring Entity, and no manufacturing or sale thereof can be
         performed by the supplier; and

     c) Other goods analogous to the foregoing.

The GPPB, in coordination with the National Innovation Council (NIC), shall
develop procurement policies encompassing the entire research, innovation,
and enterprise ecosystem, consistent with the principles under Section 3 of
this IRR. To foster innovation, relevant government agencies shall expedite
the release of goods used in and documents necessary for Science,
Technology, and Innovation.

The GPPB shall likewise issue the guidelines on the implementation of this
mode of procurement.

Section 38. Video Recording of All Procurement-Related Conferences for
Competitive Bidding

38.1 To enhance the transparency of the procurement process, the Procuring
     Entity shall keep a video recording of all procurement-related
     conferences for Competitive Bidding, which includes pre-procurement
     conference, pre-bid conference, bid opening, and other meetings of the
     BAC. All procurement-related conferences for Competitive Bidding shall
     not commence without a video recording initiated by the BAC.


                                                                            70
38.2 The Procuring Entity shall also livestream the preliminary examination
     and the opening of the bids to the public on its website, social media
     account, or any other form of livestreaming services.

       The GPPB, in coordination with the DICT, shall issue specific guidelines
       on the conduct of the livestream requirement under this provision.

38.3 The mandatory video recording shall only apply to the procurement of
     Goods costing above Ten Million Pesos (₱10,000,000.00), Infrastructure
     Projects costing above Twenty Million Pesos (₱20,000,000.00), and
     Consulting Services costing above Five Million Pesos (₱5,000,000.00)
     using Competitive Bidding as the mode of procurement.

38.4 The Procuring Entity shall ensure that copies of the video recording shall
     be stored for not less than five (5) years and shall be made available to
     the public upon request and payment of a fee fixed by the Procuring
     Entity, subject to existing budgeting, accounting, and auditing laws, rules,
     and regulations.

When national security is involved, the HoPE shall decide whether or not to
video record all procurement related conferences, taking into consideration the
nature, classification, sensitivity, and confidentiality thereof.

The GPPB is authorized to adjust the threshold amounts and the storage
period as may be deemed appropriate.

Section 39. Prohibition on Splitting of Government Contracts

Splitting of Government Contracts is not allowed. In using any of the modes of
procurement under Article IV of the Act, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that
this does not result in splitting of government contracts, which involves dividing
or breaking up of contracts into smaller quantities and amounts, or dividing
contract implementation into artificial phases or subcontracts for the purpose
of evading or circumventing the requirements of the Act and this IRR; Provided,
That procurement per unit, by lot or package, is allowed subject to the available
budget, required quantity, product availability, delivery sites, geographical
location and market capacity.

For Infrastructure Projects to be implemented by phases, the Procuring Entity
shall ensure that there is a clear delineation of work for each phase, which
must be usable and structurally sound, in accordance with the Detailed
Architectural and Engineering Design as developed in accordance with
Section 8 of this IRR.

Section 40. Procurement of CSE

40.1    All NGAs, GOCCs, GFIs, SUCs, and LGUs shall procure CSE only from
        the PS-DBM, subject to its availability.



                                                                                71
40.2   Procuring Entities are authorized to procure the CSE from other sources
       in any of the following instances:

       a) If the CSE is unavailable due to zero inventory, in which case the
          Procuring Entity shall secure a Certificate of Non-Availability of
          Stocks by downloading from the PhilGEPS Electronic Catalogue;

       b) If the technical specifications of the CSE are not sufficient to meet
          the Procuring Entity’s specific needs and requirements, in which
          case the PE shall secure a complete list of technical specifications
          of all CSE items by downloading from the PhilGEPS Electronic
          Catalogue;

       c) If the available stock of the CSE is not sufficient to meet the required
          quantity of the Procuring Entity, in which case the Procuring Entity
          shall generate and download the current Stock Position Report from
          the PhilGEPS Electronic Catalogue showing the available stock at
          the specific time and date of access; and

       d) When the BAC, upon recommendation of the End-User or
          Implementing Unit, has resolved that the procurement from other
          sources is for reasons of efficiency, practicality, or economic
          viability. To support this, the End-User or Implementing Unit shall
          submit its written recommendation to the BAC identifying the specific
          reason and providing justifications thereof. To ensure proper
          monitoring of this instance, which could aid the PS-DBM in
          addressing gaps in supply chain and inventory management, the
          Procuring Entity shall inform the PS-DBM by filling out and
          submitting an online form available in the PhilGEPS Electronic
          Catalogue. In assessing the existence of the foregoing reasons,
          Procuring Entities may refer to the following instances:

              i) Inefficiency – Procurement from the PS-DBM will require
                 extensive time and effort on the part of the Procuring Entity
                 leading to wastage, delays or errors compared to
                 conventional procurement methods.

              ii) Impracticality – Procurement from the PS-DBM will be
                  excessively difficult due to an unforeseen event or a lack of
                  feasible means or access, which includes no internet
                  connectivity or geographical limitations.

              iii) Economic Non-viability – Procurement from the PS is not
                   sustainable since it will not result in realized savings for the
                   government in the long-term. This may pertain to the cost
                   where it would be more expensive, or non-cost factors such
                   as issues in product quality and life cycle cost
                   considerations.




                                                                                 72
       40.3   Due to the efficiency and economy of bulk purchasing, the PS-
              DBM may deal directly with manufacturers or exclusive
              distributors subject to    legal, technical, and financial
              requirements ensuring that products are      obtained from
              reliable sources, of the best quality, and at the most
              advantageous price for the whole government. Access to goods
              and equipment in economic lot sizes may likewise be achieved
              by PS-DBM through consignment or any appropriate contractual
              arrangement.

              The PS-DBM may use the modes of procurement enumerated
              under Rule IV of this IRR, or deal directly with manufacturers or
              exclusive distributors whether to gain access to the supply or to
              obtain the rights to sell, distribute, or otherwise deliver the CSE
              to Procuring Entities through consignment or any appropriate
              contractual arrangement; Provided, That these manufacturers or
              exclusive distributors comply with the requirements set by PS-
              DBM to determine their legal, technical, and financial capacity in
              providing the required goods or services; Provided, further, That
              such requirements shall be set or formulated to ensure that the
              goods or services are obtained from reliable sources, of the best
              quality, and at the most advantageous price for the whole of
              government.

40.4   For purposes of this IRR, consignment shall refer to an arrangement
       whereby the consignor gives actual or constructive possession of
       goods, equipment and services to the consignee without transfer of
       ownership and disbursement of government funds between consignee
       and consignor, and such goods, equipment and services are to be sold
       by the consignee for and on account of the consignor at terms
       advantageous to the government. The consignee shall remit the
       proceeds of the sale to the consignor, net of service fees, if applicable.
       The PhilGEPS eMarketplace may be used as a consignment platform
       for goods and equipment.

       Consignment agreements shall primarily be governed by the general
       law on contracts, considering that the transaction involved is not
       procurement as defined under Section 5(z) of this IRR.

40.5 PS DBM, which is primarily tasked with the centralized procurement of
     CSE for the government in accordance with Letter of Instructions No.
     755, s. 1978, EO No. 359, s. of 1989, and Administrative Order No. 17,
     s. of 2011, shall develop the parameters in the identification, expansion,
     and definition of requirements and specifications of CSE through the
     conduct of market scoping, market survey, and market availability.

       40.5.1 For goods to be classified as CSE, the following conditions shall
              be met:




                                                                               73
             a) The goods, material, supply, equipment, or service is used
                repetitively or frequently in the day-to-day operations of
                Procuring Entities in the performance of their functions;

             b) Publication by the PS-DBM of the list of CSE, with available
                classification, description, and other relevant information,
                once in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general
                circulation; and

             c) Posting of the CSE and its complete technical specifications
                in the PhilGEPS Electronic Catalogue.

      40.5.2 In operating and maintaining a centralized procurement system
             for CSE, the PS-DBM shall be authorized to perform the following
             functions:

      a) Identification and review of technical specifications for CSE.

         In determining the technical specifications of the CSE, the PS-DBM
         must identify the standards that should be met by the CSE in terms
         of function, performance, environmental, and sustainability
         considerations. The PS-DBM may adopt established standards and
         quality as formulated by appropriate government entities or similar
         international bodies.

         The PS-DBM shall also specify the means of verification of the CSE,
         to ensure conformity with the technical specifications in accordance
         with applicable laws and standards.

      b) Expansion or reduction of the list of CSE.

         The PS-DBM shall regularly study, review, and rationalize the list of
         CSE to develop the appropriate strategy on how to procure them.
         Depending on market availability and needs of the agencies, the PS-
         DBM may add or delist items in the list of CSE. The PS-DBM shall
         submit a report to the GPPB of any modification to the list of CSE.

             procurement is decentralized, the head of each decentralized
             unit, which is individually considered as a Procuring Entity, shall


                                                                              74

     eligibility of the bidder, the responsiveness of its bid to the technical
     requirements, and the lowest financial bid.

     MEARB shall be used in the procurement of Goods or Infrastructure
     Projects where the considerations for the award of contract are the
     eligibility of the bidder, and the responsiveness of its bid to the technical
     requirements; and the determination of the most economically
     advantageous bid in reference to the quality-price ratio allocated to the
     technical and financial components of the bid.

     MARB shall be used in the procurement of Goods or Infrastructure
     Projects where the considerations for the award of contract are the
     eligibility of the bidder, the responsiveness of its bid to the technical
     requirements, and the most advantageous bid in reference to the highest
     rated offer based on the quality component of the bid.

     HRRB shall be used in the procurement of Consulting Services where
     the considerations for the award of contract are the eligibility and
     qualifications of the bidder, the responsiveness of its bid to the technical
     requirements, and the highest rated offer in reference to the weighted
     quality-cost criteria for Quality-Cost Based Evaluation, or the highest
     rated technical proposal for Quality-Based Evaluation.

Section 51. Pre-bid Conference

51.1   For procurement projects to be bid through competitive selection such
       as competitive bidding, competitive dialogue, limited source bidding,
       and unsolicited offer with bid matching, with an ABC of Three Million
       Pesos (₱3,000,000.00) or more, the BAC shall conduct at least one (1)
       pre-bid conference to clarify or explain any of the requirements, terms,
       conditions, and specifications stipulated in the Bidding Documents. For
       procurement projects with an ABC of less than Three Million Pesos
       (₱3,000,000), pre-bid conferences may be conducted at the discretion
       of the BAC. Subject to the approval of the BAC, a pre-bid conference
       may also be conducted upon written request of any prospective bidder.

51.2   The pre-bid conference shall be held at least twelve (12) calendar days
       before the deadline for the submission and receipt of bids, but not earlier
       than seven (7) calendar days from the PhilGEPS posting of the
       Invitation to Bid or Bidding Documents and in the case of Consulting
       Services, from the determination of the shortlisted consultants.

51.3   The pre-bid conference shall discuss, clarify, and explain, among other
       things, the eligibility requirements and the technical and financial
       components of the procurement project, including questions and
       clarifications raised by the prospective bidders before and during the
       pre-bid conference.

The BAC shall have a proactive role during the conduct of the pre-bid
conference:

   a) The BAC shall discuss the requirements for a particular procurement
      project, as stated in the Bidding Documents. The BAC may also conduct
      a walk-through and presentation of the documents required, including
      the presentation of sample documents, mathematical computations, or
      the manner of filling up forms, as the case may be. The BAC shall not
      merely rely on the questions raised by the prospective bidders but must
      initiate discussions on the requirements of the project.

   b) The BAC shall likewise discuss the common reasons for bidders’
      disqualifications based on its experiences in previous procurement



                                                                                90
       projects. Accordingly, the BAC shall present and explain the ways to
       prevent similar occasions of disqualification.

Pre-bid conference may be conducted in person, face-to-face, or online
through videoconferencing, webcasting, or similar technology, or a
combination thereof. Procuring Entities with videoconferencing capabilities
that have manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, and/or
consultants that also have videoconferencing capabilities may conduct their
pre-bid conferences electronically. The pre-bid conference is open to
prospective bidders, and in case of procurement of Consulting Services, the
shortlisted bidder/s, but attendance shall not be mandatory.

51.4   The proceedings of the pre-bid conference shall be recorded, and the
       corresponding minutes shall be prepared not later than five (5) calendar
       days after the pre-bid conference and shall be made available to
       prospective bidders not later than five (5) calendar days upon written
       request.

       Decisions of the BAC amending any provision of the Bidding
       Documents shall be issued in writing through a Supplemental Bid
       Bulletin at least seven (7) calendar days before the deadline for the
       submission and receipt of bids.

51.5   Bid Bulletins

51.5.1 Requests for clarification(s) on any part of the Bidding Documents or for
       an interpretation must be in writing and submitted to the BAC of the
       Procuring Entity concerned at least ten (10) calendar days before the
       deadline set for the submission and receipt of bids. The BAC shall
       respond to the said request by issuing a Bid Bulletin, duly signed by the
       BAC Chairperson, to be made available to all those who have properly
       secured the Bidding Documents, at least seven (7) calendar days
       before the deadline for the submission and receipt of bids.

51.5.2 For purposes of clarifying or modifying any provision of the Bidding
       Documents, Bid Bulletins may be issued upon the Procuring Entity’s
       initiative at least seven (7) calendar days before the deadline for the
       submission and receipt of bids. Any modification to the Bidding
       Documents shall be identified as an amendment.

51.5.3 Any Bid Bulletin issued by the BAC shall also be posted in the
      PhilGEPS, in any conspicuous place in the premises of the Procuring
      Entity, and on the website or social media platforms of the Procuring
      Entity, if available, or such other channels as may be authorized by the
      GPPB. It shall be the responsibility of all those who have properly
      secured the Bidding Documents to inquire and secure Bid Bulletins that
      may be issued by the BAC. However, bidders who have submitted bids
      before the issuance of the Bid Bulletin must be informed and allowed to
      modify or withdraw their bids in accordance with Section 55 of this IRR.



                                                                              91

Section 52. Eligibility Requirements for the Procurement of Goods,
Infrastructure Projects, and Consulting Services

52.1   For purposes of determining the eligibility of bidders using the criteria
       stated in Section 52.4 of this IRR, the prospective bidder shall submit
       its valid and updated PhilGEPS Certificate of Registration (Platinum
       Membership) pursuant to the requirements provided in Section 20 of
       this IRR.

       To ensure that the prospective bidder is technically and financially
       capable to undertake the procurement project, the BAC shall also
       require the submission of the following documents using the forms
       prescribed in the Bidding Documents:

          a) Statement of the bidder of all its ongoing government and private
             contracts, including contracts awarded but not yet started, if any,
             whether similar or not similar in nature and complexity to the
             procurement project;

          b) For Goods and Infrastructure Projects, Statement of the bidder’s
             SLCC similar to the procurement project, except under
             conditions provided for in Sections 52.4.1.3 and 52.4.2.4 of this
             IRR, within the relevant period as provided in the Bidding
             Documents in the case of Goods;

          c) For Goods and Infrastructure Projects, the bidder’s computation
             of NFCC. However, in the case of procurement of Goods, a
             bidder may submit a committed Line of Credit from a universal,
             rural, or commercial bank, in lieu of its NFCC computation; and

          d) For Consulting Services, a statement of the consultant specifying
             its nationality and confirming that those who will actually perform
             the service are registered professionals authorized by the
             appropriate regulatory body to practice those professions and
             allied professions, including their respective curriculum vitae.

       To facilitate the determination of eligibility, the BAC of a Procuring Entity
       shall use the contents of the PhilGEPS electronic registry of
       manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, or consultants, in
       accordance with Section 20 of this IRR.

52.2 In case the prospective bidder is a joint venture, the following documents
      shall be required:

               a) For Goods and Consulting Services, a valid joint venture
                  agreement (JVA), in case the joint venture is already in


                                                                                  92
                    existence. In the absence of a JVA, duly notarized
                    statements from all the potential joint venture partners
                    should be included in the bid, stating that they will enter into
                    and abide by the provisions of the JVA in the event that the
                    bid is successful. Failure to enter into a joint venture in the
                    event of a contract award shall be a ground for the forfeiture
                    of the bid security.

               b) For Infrastructure Projects, JV bidders shall submit a JVA in
                  accordance with RA No. 4566 or the “Contractors' License
                  Law” and its IRR.

       Each partner of the joint venture shall submit their respective PhilGEPS
       Certificates of Registration in accordance with Section 20.2.9.1 of this
       IRR. The submission of technical and financial eligibility documents by
       any of the joint venture partners constitutes compliance; Provided, That
       the partner responsible to submit the NFCC shall likewise submit the
       Statement of all of its ongoing contracts.

52.3   In the case of foreign bidders, the eligibility requirements or statements,
       the bids, and all other documents to be submitted to the BAC must be
       in English. If the eligibility requirements or statements, the bids, and all
       other documents submitted to the BAC are in a foreign language other
       than English, it must be accompanied by a translation of the documents
       in English. The documents shall be translated by the relevant foreign
       government agency, the foreign government agency authorized to
       translate documents, or a registered translator in the foreign bidder’s
       country; and shall be authenticated by the appropriate Philippine foreign
       service establishment or post or the equivalent office having jurisdiction
       over the foreign bidder’s affairs in the Philippines.

       However, for Contracting Parties to the Apostille Convention, the
       documents shall be authenticated through an apostille by the
       Competent Authority, as defined in Section 20.9.2 of this IRR, except
       for countries identified by the DFA that will still require legalization (red
       ribbon) by the relevant Embassy or Consulate.

                                                                                  93
         c) Corporations duly organized under the laws of the
            Philippines, and of which at least sixty percent
            (60%) of the outstanding capital stock belongs to
            citizens of the Philippines;

         d) Cooperatives duly organized under the laws of the
            Philippines; or

         e) Persons or entities forming themselves into a joint

            Provided, however, That Filipino ownership or
            interest of the joint venture concerned shall be at
            least sixty percent (60%). For this purpose, Filipino
            ownership or interest shall be based on the
            contributions of each of the members of the joint
            venture as specified in their JVA: Provided further,
            That the primary purpose of each member of the
            joint venture must be similar or related to the
            requirement of the project to be bid out.

52.4.1.2 Foreign bidders may be eligible to participate under any
         of the following circumstances in accordance with the
         guidelines issued by the GPPB:

              a) When provided for under any treaty or
                 international or executive agreement as
                 provided in Section 4 of the Act and this IRR;

              b) When the foreign supplier is a citizen,
                 corporation, or association of a country, the
                 laws, or regulations of which grant reciprocal
                 rights or privileges to citizens, corporations, or
                 associations of the Philippines;

              c) When the goods sought to be procured are not
                 available from local suppliers; or

              d) When there is a need to prevent situations that
                 defeat competition or restrain trade.

52.4.1.3 The bidder must have completed, within a period of ten
(10) years from the submission of the bid, unless a shorter period
is indicated in the Invitation to Bid, an SLCC that is similar to the
procurement project to be bid, and whose value, adjusted to
current prices using the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)
consumer price indices, must be at least fifty percent (50%) of
the ABC.


                                                                   94
      If the Procuring Entity determines that it is necessary to adopt a
      different SLCC requirement to ensure broader bidder
      participation while establishing their technical capacity, it may
      allow bidders to present a combination of contracts completed
      within the same period, provided their total value is at least fifty
      percent (50%) of the ABC, thus:

             a) The bidder should have completed at least one (1)
             similar contract amounting to at least 25% of the ABC; and

             b) The bidder should have completed other contracts,
             whether similar or not, with an aggregate amount of at
             least 25% of the ABC.

      For this purpose, the Procuring Entity may clarify in the Bidding
      Documents the definition or description of what it considers to be
      a similar project, which must be germane to the kind, class, or
      genus of goods or services to be procured guided by the principle
      of proportionality and fit-for-purpose approach.

      52.4.1.4 The computation of a bidder’s NFCC must be at least
               equal to the ABC to be bid, calculated as follows:

             NFCC = [(Current assets minus current liabilities) (15)]

         further, That contractors under Small A and Small B
         categories without similar experience on the

         the cost of such contract is not more than the Allowable
         Range of Contract Cost of their registration based on

         For foreign-funded procurement, the GoP and the
         foreign government, or foreign or international financing
         institution may agree on another track record
         requirement.

         Moreover, a contract shall be considered similar to the
         procurement project if it has the same major categories
         of work. The Procuring Entity may clarify in the Bidding
         Documents what is regarded as major categories of
         work guided by the principle of proportionality and fit-
         for-purpose approach.

         including awarded contracts yet to be started,
         coinciding with the procurement project to be bid;

         which shall be submitted to the GPPB for consideration.

               current liabilities shall be based on the latest AFS
               submitted to the BIR.

               For the purpose of computing the foreign bidders'
               NFCC, the value of the current assets and current
               liabilities shall be based on their AFS prepared in
               accordance with international financial reporting
               standards.

     submitted after the deadline shall not be accepted by the BAC. The BAC
     shall record in the minutes of the meeting of the submission and opening
     of bids, the bidder’s name, its representative, and the time the late bid
     was submitted.

54.7 To ensure transparency and accurate representation of the bid
     submission, the BAC Secretariat shall notify in writing all bidders whose
     bids it has received through mail at its PhilGEPS-registered physical



                                                                                103
       address or official e-mail address. The notice shall be issued within
       seven (7) calendar days from the date of the bid opening.

54.8 The original copy of the bid form shall be typewritten or written in ink
     and shall be signed by the bidder or its duly authorized representative.

54.9 Unsealed or unmarked bid envelopes, or in case of electronic bid
     submission, Bidding Documents not in compressed archive folders and
     are not password-protected, shall be rejected. However, bid envelopes
     that are not properly sealed and marked or not properly compressed
     and password-protected, as required in the Bidding Documents, shall
     be accepted; Provided, That the bidder or its duly authorized
     representative shall acknowledge such condition of the bid as
     submitted. The BAC shall assume no responsibility for misplaced or lost
     contents of the improperly sealed or marked bid or improperly
     compressed or password-protected folder, or for its premature opening.

Section 55. Modification and Withdrawal of Bids

55.1   Bidders may modify their bids; Provided, That this is done before the
       deadline for the receipt of bids. For manual submission and receipt of
       bids, where bidders modify their bids, they shall not be allowed to
       retrieve their original bid, but shall only be allowed to send another bid
       equally sealed, properly identified, linked to their original bid, and
       marked as a “modification,” thereof, and stamped “received” by the
       BAC. Bid modifications received after the applicable deadline shall not
       be considered and shall be returned to the bidder unopened.

       For online or electronic bid submission, where bidders modify their Bid,
       they shall not be allowed to retrieve their original Bid but shall only be
       allowed to send another Bid equally secured and properly identified. In
       the case of electronic submission, it shall be labelled as a “modification”
       of the one previously submitted. The time indicated in the latest bid
       receipt page generated shall be the official time of submission. Bids
       submitted after the deadline shall not be accepted.

55.2 Bidders may, through a letter, withdraw their bids before the deadline
     for the receipt of bids. Withdrawal of bids after the applicable deadline
     shall be subject to appropriate sanctions as prescribed in this IRR.
     Bidders may also express their intention not to participate in the bidding
     through a letter which should reach and be stamped received by the
     BAC before the deadline for the receipt of bids. Bidders that withdraw
     their bids shall no longer be allowed to submit another bid for the same
     contract directly or indirectly.

Section 56. Bid Security

56.1   All bids in modes of procurement that are competitive in nature,
       particularly competitive bidding, competitive dialogue, unsolicited offer
       with bid matching, and limited source bidding shall be accompanied by


                                                                               104
       a bid security, payable to the Procuring Entity concerned as a guarantee
       that the successful bidder shall, within ten (10) calendar days from
       receipt of the Notice of Award, enter into contract with the Procuring
       Entity and furnish the performance security required in Section 68 of
       this IRR, except when Section 66.1 of this IRR allows a longer period.
       Failure to enclose the required bid security in the form and amount
       prescribed herein shall automatically disqualify the bid concerned.

56.2   The bidder shall submit a Bid Securing Declaration, or any form of bid
       security in an amount not less than the required percentage of the ABC
       in accordance with the following schedule:

                                                  Amount of Bid Security
             Form of Bid Security               (Not less than the required
                                                  percentage of the ABC)
       a) Cash, or cashier’s or
       manager’s check issued by a
       bank. For biddings conducted by
       LGUs, the cashier’s or manager’s             Two percent (2%)
       check may be issued by other
       banks certified by the BSP as
       authorized to issue such financial
       instrument.
       b) Bank draft or guarantee, or
       irrevocable letter of credit issued by
       a bank; Provided, however, That it
       shall be confirmed or authenticated
       by a bank, if issued by a foreign
       bank. For biddings conducted by               Five percent (5%)
       LGUs, bank draft or guarantee, or
       irrevocable letter of credit may be
       issued by other banks certified by
       the BSP as authorized to issue such
       financial instrument.

       c) Surety bond callable upon
       demand issued by a surety or
       insurance company duly certified              Five percent (5%)
       by the Insurance Commission as
       authorized to issue such security.

56.3   The procuring entity shall indicate in the Bidding Documents at least
       three (3) acceptable forms of bid security that bidders may choose from,
       which shall include Bid Securing Declaration, provided in Section 56.6
       of this IRR.

56.4   The bid security shall be denominated in Philippine Peso and posted in
       favor of the Procuring Entity.



                                                                            105
56.5   Without prejudice to the provisions of the Act and this IRR on the
       forfeiture of bid securities, bid securities shall be returned only after the
       bidder with the LCRB, MEARB, MARB, or HRRB, as the case may be,
       has signed the contract and furnished the performance security, except
       to those declared by the BAC as failed or post-disqualified in
       accordance with this IRR, upon submission of a written waiver of their
       right to file a request for reconsideration and/or protest.

56.6   A Bid Securing Declaration is an undertaking which states, among
       others, that the bidder shall enter into contract with the Procuring Entity
       and furnish the required performance security within ten (10) calendar
       days, as indicated in the Bidding Documents, from receipt of the Notice
       of Award, and commits to pay the corresponding amount as fine and be
       automatically disqualified from bidding of any procurement contract of
       any Procuring Entity for a period of time, upon receipt of the Blacklisting
       Order, in the event it violates any of the conditions stated therein as
       required in the guidelines issued by the GPPB.

56.7   In no case shall the bid security be returned later than the expiration of
       the bid validity period indicated in the Bidding Documents, unless it has
       been extended in accordance with Section 57.2 of this IRR. In case the
       bidder is required to extend its bid validity for grounds as provided in
       this IRR, the bidder may, at its discretion, substitute a Bid Securing
       Declaration as a replacement for its bid security; Provided, That the
       option to substitute is indicated in the bidding documents.

Section 57. Bid Validity

57.1   Bids and bid securities shall be valid for a reasonable period as
       determined by the HoPE concerned, which shall be indicated in the
       Bidding Documents, but in no case shall the period exceed one hundred
       twenty (120) calendar days from the date of the opening of bids.

57.2   Should it become necessary to extend the validity of the bids and the
       bid securities beyond one hundred twenty (120) calendar days, the
       Procuring Entity concerned shall request in writing all those who
       submitted bids for such extension before the expiration date therefor.
       Bidders, however, shall have the right to refuse to grant such extension
       without forfeiting their bid security.

Section 58. Bid Opening

The BAC shall open the bids immediately after the deadline for the submission
and receipt of bids. The time, date, and place of the opening of bids shall be
specified in the Bidding Documents.

The manner of opening of the bids for Goods and Infrastructure Projects shall
depend on the award criterion to be adopted, as follows:




                                                                                 106
   a) For LCRB, the BAC shall open the technical and financial proposals on
      the same day; and

   b) For MEARB or MARB, only the technical proposals shall be opened
      while the financial proposals shall remain unopened and be secured by
      the BAC until the specified time of their opening as indicated in the
      Bidding Documents. Only the financial proposals of the bidders who
      have met the minimum technical score for MEARB or the highest
      technical score for MARB shall be opened.

For electronic bid submission, if applicable, the passwords for accessing the
Bidding Documents will be disclosed by the Bidders only during the actual bid
opening which may be done in person or through videoconferencing,
webcasting, or similar technology.

In case the bids cannot be opened as scheduled due to justifiable reasons, the
BAC shall secure the bids submitted and reschedule the opening of bids on
the next working day or at the soonest possible time through the issuance of a
Notice of Postponement to be posted on the PhilGEPS website and the
website of the Procuring Entity concerned.

The bidders or their duly authorized representatives may attend the opening
of bids. The BAC shall ensure the integrity, security, and confidentiality of all
submitted bids. The abstract of bids as read, and the minutes of the bid
opening shall be made available to the public upon written request and
payment of a specified fee to recover the cost of materials.


                                    RULE IX
                                BID EVALUATION

Section 59. Preliminary Examination of Bids

59.1   Prior to bid evaluation, the BAC shall open the first bid envelopes in
       public to determine each bidder’s compliance with the documents
       required to be submitted for the eligibility and technical requirements,
       as prescribed in this IRR. For this purpose, the BAC shall check the
       submitted documents of each bidder against a checklist of required
       documents to ascertain if they are all present, using a non-discretionary
       “pass or fail” criterion, as stated in the Instructions to Bidders. If a bidder
       submitted the required document, it shall be rated “passed” for that
       particular requirement. In this regard, bids that fail to include any
       requirement or are incomplete, or patently insufficient shall be
       considered as “failed.” Otherwise, the BAC shall rate the first bid
       envelope as “passed.”

       Receipt of the scanned copies of the first bid envelope with the required
       forms prescribed in this IRR, which are for online or electronic bid
       submission, shall be considered as compliant with the requirements of



                                                                                   107
       the said bid submission, subject to the submission of the original copies
       of the following:

       a) Bid Securing Declaration, or other forms of bid security, excluding
          cash; and
       b) Omnibus Sworn Statement.

       These forms shall be submitted by the bidder during the post-
       qualification stage.

       The non-submission of these forms within the prescribed period shall
       render the bid submission as non-compliant and shall result in the post-
       disqualification of the bidder.

59.2   Immediately after determining compliance with the requirements in the
       first bid envelope, the BAC shall open the second bid envelope of each
       remaining eligible bidder whose technical proposal contained in the first
       bid envelope was rated “passed.” The second bid envelope of each
       compliant bidder shall be opened within the same day, except as
       provided under Sections 58 and 62 of this IRR. In case any of the
       requirements in the second bid envelope of a particular bid is missing,
       incomplete, or patently insufficient, and/or if the submitted total bid price
       exceeds the ABC, the BAC shall rate the bid concerned as “failed.” Only
       bids determined to contain all the bid requirements for both components
       shall be rated “passed” and immediately considered for evaluation and
       comparison.

       Receipt of the scanned copies of the second bid envelope with the
       required forms such as the duly signed bid form, price schedules, or
       other forms prescribed in this IRR, for electronic or online bid
       submission, shall be considered as compliant with the requirements of
       the said bid submission.

59.3   For the procurement of Goods and Infrastructure Projects using
       MEARB as award criteria, the detailed implementation of the procedure
       specified in this Section shall be provided in Sections 61.3 to 61.8 of
       this IRR.

59.4   For the procurement of Consulting Services, the detailed
       implementation of the procedure specified in this Section shall be as
       provided in Section 62 of this IRR.

Section 60. Ceiling for Bid Prices

60.1   The ABC shall be the upper limit or ceiling for acceptable bid prices. If
       a bid price, as evaluated and calculated in accordance with this IRR, is
       higher than the ABC, the bidder submitting the same shall be
       automatically disqualified. There shall be no lower limit or floor on the
       amount of the award.



                                                                                 108
60.2   For foreign-funded procurement, the ABC shall be applied as the
       ceiling: Provided, That the following conditions are met:

       a) Bidding Documents are obtainable free of charge on a freely
          accessible website. If payment of Bidding Documents is required by
          the Procuring Entity, payment could be made upon the submission
          of bids;

       b) The Procuring Entity has procedures in place to ensure that the ABC
          is based on recent estimates made by the engineer or the
          responsible unit of the Procuring Entity and that the estimates are
          based on adequate detailed engineering (in the case of
          Infrastructure Projects) and reflect the quality, supervision and risk
          and inflationary factors, as well as prevailing market prices,
          associated with the types of Goods or Infrastructure Projects to be
          procured;

       c) The Procuring Entity has trained cost estimators in estimating prices
          and analyzing bid variances. In the case of Infrastructure Projects,
          the Procuring Entity must also have trained quantity surveyors;

       d) The Procuring Entity has established a system to monitor, and report
          bid prices relative to the ABC and the engineer’s or Procuring
          Entity’s estimate; and

       e) The Procuring Entity has established a monitoring and evaluation
          system for contract implementation to provide feedback on actual
          total costs of Goods and Infrastructure Projects.

However, the GoP and the foreign government, or foreign or international
financing institution may agree to waive the foregoing conditions.

Section 61. Bid Evaluation for the Procurement of Goods and
Infrastructure Projects

61.1   Members of the BAC, its staff and personnel, Secretariat, and TWG, as
       well as Observers, are prohibited from making or accepting any
       communication with any bidder regarding the evaluation of their bids
       until the issuance of the Notice of Award. However, the BAC, through
       its Secretariat, may ask the bidder in writing for clarification of its bid. All
       responses to requests for clarification shall be in writing.

61.2   For the procurement of Goods and Infrastructure Projects, the BAC
       shall evaluate the financial component of the bids to determine the
       lowest calculated bid (LCB) using the following steps:

       61.2.1 The BAC shall immediately conduct a detailed evaluation of all
              bids using non-discretionary criteria in considering the following:




                                                                                   109
              a) Completeness of the bid. Unless the Instructions to Bidders
                 specifically allow partial bids, bids not addressing or providing
                 all of the required items in the Bidding Documents including,
                 where applicable, bill of quantities, shall be considered non-
                 responsive and, thus, automatically disqualified.

                  However, when no price or a zero (0) or a dash (-) is indicated
                  in a required item in the bid form, the same would mean that
                  it is being offered for free to the Government, except those
                  required by law or regulations to be provided for; and

              b) Arithmetical corrections. The BAC shall consider
                 computational errors and omissions to enable proper
                 comparison of all eligible bids. It may also consider bid
                 modifications if expressly allowed in the Bidding Documents.
                 Any adjustment shall be calculated in monetary terms to
                 determine the calculated prices.

       61.2.2 The BAC shall evaluate all bids on an equal footing to ensure fair
              and competitive bid comparison. For this purpose, all bidders
              shall be required to include the cost of all taxes, such as, but not
              limited to, value-added tax (VAT), income tax, local taxes, and
              other fiscal levies and duties, if applicable, which shall be
              itemized in the bid form and reflected in the detailed estimates.
              Such bids, including said taxes, shall be the basis for the bid
              evaluation and comparison.

       61.2.3 In case of discrepancies between: (i) bid prices in figures and in
              words, the latter shall prevail; (ii) total price per item and unit
              price for the item as extended or multiplied by the quantity of that
              item, the latter shall prevail; (iii) stated total price and the actual
              sum of prices of component items, the latter shall prevail; (iv) unit
              cost in the detailed estimate and unit cost in the bill of quantities,
              the latter shall prevail; and (v) amount in price schedule and in
              the bid form, the latter shall prevail.

       61.2.4 Bids shall then be ranked in the ascending order of their total
              calculated bid prices, as evaluated and corrected for
              computational errors, and other bid modifications, to identify the
              LCB. Total calculated bid prices, as evaluated and corrected for
              computational errors, and other bid modifications, which exceed
              the ABC shall be disqualified.

       61.2.5 The entire evaluation process for the procurement of Goods and
       Infrastructure Projects using LCB as criteria shall be completed within
       seven (7) calendar days from the deadline for receipt of proposals.

61.3   For the procurement of Goods and Infrastructure Projects using
       MEARB as award criteria, the BAC shall evaluate the quality and price



                                                                                  110
        proposals to determine the Most Economically Advantageous Bid
        (MEAB) using the following steps:

        a) The quality proposal together with the price proposal shall be
           considered in the evaluation of bids. The quality proposals shall be
           evaluated first using the criteria in Section 61.4 of this IRR. The price
           proposals of the bids who meet the minimum quality score shall then
           be opened.

        b) The price and quality proposals shall be given corresponding
           weights with the price proposal given a minimum weight of fifteen
           percent (15%) up to a maximum of forty percent (40%). The weight
           of the quality criteria shall be adjusted accordingly such that their
           total weight in percent together with the weight given to the price
           proposal shall be equal to one hundred percent (100%). To further
           promote green public procurement, the sustainability of products,
           materials, or structures with green specifications shall be given
           greater weight in the evaluation of bids. The exact weights shall be
           approved by the BAC upon the recommendation of the End-User or
           Implementing Unit and indicated in the Bidding Documents. The
           BAC shall rank the bidders in descending order based on the
           combined numerical ratings of their quality and price proposals. The
           bidder with the best overall score using the quality-price ratio shall
           be referred to as the MEAB.

        c) The HoPE shall approve or disapprove the recommendations of the
           BAC within two (2) calendar days after receipt of the results of the
           evaluation from the BAC.

61.4 The quality component shall be assessed on the basis of criteria with
corresponding numerical weights indicated in the Bidding Documents, which
may include qualitative, environmental, or social aspects linked to the subject
matter of the contract. These may include any or a combination of the
following:

   a) Quality and technical merit, including technical competence and a
      credible track record;

   b) Aesthetic and functional design and characteristics;

   c) Approach and methodology;

   d) Accessibility;

   e) Tools and equipment;

   f)   Social, environmental, economic, and innovative characteristics;

   g) Organization, qualification, and experience of employees or staff
      assigned to perform the contract;


                                                                                 111
   h) Ongoing contracts and work commitments;

   i)   After-sales service and technical assistance;

   j)   Delivery conditions, such as delivery period and delivery process;

   k) Disposal measures; or

   l) Other relevant criteria in relation to the subject Goods or Infrastructure
      Projects to be procured.

61.5    In order to eliminate bias in evaluating the quality proposals, it is
        recommended that the highest and lowest scores for each bidder for
        each criterion shall not be considered in determining the average scores
        of the bidders, except when the evaluation is conducted in a collegial
        manner.

61.6    All participating bidders shall be furnished with the results of the
        evaluation, which shall reflect the ranking and total scores only, after
        the approval by the HoPE of the ranking. Said results shall also be
        posted in the PhilGEPS and the website of the Procuring Entity,
        whenever available, for a period of not less than seven (7) calendar
        days.

61.7    The entire evaluation process for the procurement of Goods and
        Infrastructure Projects using MEARB as criteria shall be completed
        within fourteen (14) calendar days from the deadline for receipt of
        proposals.

61.8    For the procurement of Goods and Infrastructure Projects using MARB
        as the award criterion, the BAC shall evaluate the quality proposals to
        determine the MAB using the quality components provided in Section
        61.4 of this IRR. The quality components shall be assessed on the basis
        of the criteria with corresponding numerical weights indicated in the
        bidding document to determine the bidder with the highest technical
        rating.

The second bid envelope of the bidder obtaining the highest technical rating
shall be opened. If the financial proposal is equal to or lower than the ABC, the
bid shall be accepted and determined as the MAB; otherwise, the same shall
be rejected and the bidder will be disqualified. The specific terms and
conditions for using the MARB as an award criterion shall be specified in the
guidelines to be issued by the GPPB.

Section 62. Bid Evaluation of ShortListed Bidders for Consulting
Services

62.1    From submission and receipt of bids until the approval by the HoPE of
        the ranking of shortlisted bidders, those that have submitted their bids


                                                                              112
       are prohibited from making any communication with any BAC member,
       including its staff and personnel, as well as its Secretariat and TWG,
       regarding matters connected to their bids. However, the BAC, through
       its Secretariat, may ask the bidder in writing for clarification of its bid. All
       responses to requests for clarification shall be in writing.

62.2   The purpose of bid evaluation is to determine the Highest Rated Bid
       using the following steps:

       62.2.1 The BAC shall conduct a detailed evaluation of bids using either
              of the following evaluation procedures as specified in the Bidding
              Documents:

            62.2.1.1 Quality-Based Evaluation Procedure

              a) A two-stage procedure shall be adopted whereby each
                 consultant shall be required to submit its technical and
                 financial proposals simultaneously in separate sealed
                 envelopes.

              b) After the receipt of bids, the technical proposals shall first be
                 opened and evaluated, in accordance with Section 62.2.2 of
                 this IRR. The BAC shall rank the consultants in descending
                 order based on the numerical ratings of their technical
                 proposals and identify the Highest Rated Bid: Provided,
                 however, That the Highest Rated Bid shall pass the minimum
                 score indicated in the Bidding Documents.

              c) The HoPE shall approve or disapprove the recommendations
                 of the BAC within two (2) calendar days after receipt of the
                 results of the evaluation from the BAC.

              d) After approval by the HoPE of the Highest Rated Bid, its
                 financial proposal shall then be opened. The BAC shall,
                 within three (3) calendar days, notify and invite the consultant
                 with the Highest Rated Bid for the opening of its financial
                 proposal for the purpose of conducting negotiations with the
                 said consultant. In the letter of notification, the BAC shall
                 inform the consultant of the issues in the technical proposal
                 the BAC may wish to clarify during negotiations.

              e) Negotiations shall be in accordance with Section 62.2.5 of
                 this IRR: Provided, That the amount indicated in the financial
                 proposal shall be made as the basis for negotiations and the
                 total contract amount shall not exceed the amount indicated
                 in the financial proposal and the ABC as stated in the Bidding
                 Documents.

              62.2.1.2 Quality-Cost Based Evaluation Procedure



                                                                                   113
   a) The technical proposal together with the financial
      proposal shall be considered in the evaluation of
      consultants. The technical proposals shall be evaluated
      first using the criteria in Section 62.2.2 of this IRR. The
      financial proposals of the consultants who meet the
      minimum technical score shall then be opened.

   b) The financial and technical proposals shall be given
      corresponding weights with the financial proposal given a
      minimum weight of fifteen percent (15%) up to a maximum
      of forty percent (40%). The weight of the technical criteria
      shall be adjusted accordingly such that their total weight
      in percent together with the weight given to the financial
      proposal shall add to one hundred percent (100%). The
      exact weights shall be approved by the HoPE upon the
      recommendation of the BAC and indicated in the Bidding
      Documents. The BAC shall rank the consultants in
      descending order based on the combined numerical
      ratings of their technical and financial proposals and
      identify the Highest Rated Bid.

   c) The HoPE shall approve or disapprove the
      recommendations of the BAC within two (2) calendar days
      after receipt of the results of the evaluation from the BAC.

   d) After approval by the HoPE of the Highest Rated Bid, the
      BAC shall, within three (3) calendar days, notify and invite
      the consultant with the Highest Rated Bid for negotiation
      in accordance with Section 62.2.5 of this IRR, except for
      the financial proposal under item (e) thereof.

62.2.2 The technical proposals of consultants shall be evaluated
       based on the following criteria and using the
       corresponding numerical weights indicated in the Bidding
       Documents:

   a) Quality of personnel to be assigned to the project, which
      covers suitability of key staff to perform the duties of the
      particular assignments, and general qualifications and
      competence including education and training of the key
      staff;

   b) Experience and capability of the consultant which include
      records of previous engagement and quality of
      performance in similar and other projects; relationship
      with previous and current clients; and, overall work
      commitments, geographical distribution of current. or
      impending projects and attention to be given by the
      consultant. The experience of the consultant to the project
      shall consider both the overall experiences of the firm and


                                                               114
       the individual experiences of the principal and key staff
       including the times when employed by other consultants;
       and

   c) Plan of approach and methodology with emphasis on the
      clarity,      feasibility,      innovativeness,       and
      comprehensiveness of the plan of approach, and the
      quality of interpretation of project problems, risks, and
      suggested solutions.

   For complex or unique undertakings, such as those involving
   new concepts or technology, or financial advisory services,
   participating short-listed consultants may be required, at the
   option of the agency concerned, to make an oral presentation
   to be presented by each consultant, or its nominated Project
   Manager or head, in case of firms, within fifteen (15) calendar
   days after the deadline for submission of technical proposals.

62.2.3 In order to eliminate bias in evaluating the technical
       proposals, it is recommended that the highest and
       lowest scores for each consultant for each criterion
       shall not be considered in determining the average
       scores of the consultants, except when the evaluation
       is conducted in a collegial manner.

62.2.4 All participating short-listed consultants shall be furnished
       with the results of the evaluation, which shall reflect the
       ranking and total scores only, after the approval by the
       HoPE of the ranking. Said results shall also be posted on
       the PhilGEPS and the website of the Procuring Entity,
       whenever available, for a period of not less than seven (7)
       calendar days.

62.2.5 Negotiations shall cover the following:

   a) Discussion and clarification of the terms of reference and
      scope of services;

   b) Discussion and finalization of the methodology and work
      program proposed by the consultant;

   c) Consideration of appropriateness of qualifications and
      pertinent compensation, number of man-months and the
      personnel to be assigned to the job, taking note of over-
      qualified personnel, to be commensurate with the
      compensation of personnel with the appropriate
      qualifications, number of man-months and schedule of
      activities which shall pertain to the manning schedule;




                                                                 115
                 d) Discussion on the services, facilities, and data, if any, to
                    be provided by the Procuring Entity concerned;

                 e) Discussion on the financial proposal submitted by the
                    consultant; and

                 f) Provisions of the contract.

                 Except for meritorious reasons, negotiations with any one
                 consultant shall be completed within ten (10) calendar days.

              62.2.6 Total calculated bid prices, as evaluated and corrected for
                     minor arithmetical corrections, such as computational
                     errors, which exceed the ABC shall not be considered.

62.3   There should be no replacement of key personnel before the awarding
       of contract, except for any delay caused by the Procuring Entity, or for
       justifiable reason as may be determined by the BAC, such as, illness,
       death, or resignation; Provided, That it is duly supported by relevant
       certificates. The BAC shall immediately consider negotiation with the
       next ranked consultant if an unjustifiable replacement of personnel by
       the first ranked firm is made. Once the contract has been awarded, no
       replacement shall be allowed by the HoPE until after fifty percent (50%)
       of the personnel’s man-months have been served, except for justifiable
       reasons, subject to appropriate sanctions as prescribed in the PBDs.

62.4   The entire evaluation process, including the submission of the results
       thereof to the HoPE for approval, shall be completed in not more than
       twenty-one (21) calendar days after the deadline for receipt of
       proposals. The proposal with the highest score shall be identified as the
       Highest Rated Bid.


                                 RULE X
                           POST-QUALIFICATION

Section 63. Objective and Process of Post-Qualification

63.1   The Bidder with the LCB, MAB, or the MEAB, in the case of Goods and
       Infrastructure Projects, or the HRB, in the case of Consulting Services,
       shall undergo post-qualification to determine whether the bidder
       concerned complies with and is responsive to all the requirements and
       conditions as specified in the Bidding Documents.

63.2   Within five (5) calendar days from receipt by the bidder of the notice
       from the BAC that the bidder has the LCB, MEAB, MAB, or HRB, the
       bidder shall submit all the eligibility documents supporting its PhilGEPS
       Certificate of Registration (Platinum Membership), its latest income and
       business tax returns filed for the preceding quarter which should not be
       earlier than two (2) quarters from the date of submission and receipt of


                                                                             116
       bid, and other appropriate licenses and permits required by law and
       stated in the Bidding Documents.

Failure to submit any of the post-qualification requirements on time, or a finding
against the veracity thereof, shall disqualify the bidder for award: Provided,
That in the event that a finding against the veracity of any of the documents
submitted is made, it shall cause the forfeiture of the Bid Security in
accordance with Article XXI of the Act and this IRR.

63.3   During post-qualification, the BAC shall verify and validate the veracity,
       authenticity, and validity of all the eligibility documents supporting the
       PhilGEPS Certificate of Registration (Platinum Membership), and all the
       other statements made, and documents submitted by the bidder with
       the LCB, MEAB, MAB, or HRB, using non-discretionary criteria, as
       stated in the Bidding Documents. These criteria shall consider, but shall
       not be limited to the following:

       a) Legal Requirements. To verify, validate, and ascertain licenses,
          certificates, permits, and agreements submitted by the bidder, and
          the fact that it is not included in any “blacklist” as provided in Section
          54 of this IRR. For this purpose, the GPPB shall maintain a portal
          which contains the consolidated file of all “blacklisted” suppliers,
          contractors, and consultants.

       b) Technical Requirements. To verify and validate the Bidder’s stated
          compliance with the requirements specified in the Bidding
          Documents.

       c) Financial Requirements. To verify and validate the bid price
          proposal of the bidder and, whenever applicable, the required
          committed Line of Credit in the amount specified and over the period
          stipulated in the Bidding Documents, or the bidder’s NFCC to
          ensure that the bidder can sustain the operating cash flow of the
          transaction.

63.4   If the BAC determines that the bidder with the LCB, MEAB, MAB, or
       HRB passes all the criteria for post-qualification, it shall declare the said
       bid as the LCRB, MEARB, or MARB, in the case of Goods and
       Infrastructure Projects, or the HRRB, in the case of Consulting Services,
       and recommend to the HoPE the award of contract to the said bidder at
       its submitted bid price or its calculated bid price, whichever is lower or,
       in the case of quality-based evaluation procedure, submitted bid price
       or its negotiated price, whichever is lower.

63.5   If, however, the BAC determines that the bidder with the LCB, MEAB,
       MAB, or HRB fails the criteria for post-qualification, it shall immediately
       notify the said bidder in writing of its post-disqualification and the
       grounds for it.




                                                                                 117
63.6   Immediately after the BAC has notified the first bidder of its post-
       disqualification, and notwithstanding any pending request for
       reconsideration thereof, the BAC shall initiate and complete the same
       post-qualification process on the bidder with the second LCB, MEAB,
       MAB, or HRB. If the second bidder passes the post-qualification and
       provided that the request for reconsideration of the first bidder has been
       denied, the second bidder shall be post-qualified as the bidder with the
       LCB, MEAB, MAB, or HRB.

63.7   If the second bidder, however, fails the post-qualification, the procedure
       for post-qualification shall be repeated for the bidder with the next LCB,
       MEAB, MAB, or HRB, and so on, until the LCRB, MEARB, MARB, or
       HRRB, as the case may be, is determined for award, subject to Section
       66 of this IRR.

63.8   The post-qualification process shall be completed in not more than
       twelve (12) calendar days from the determination of the LCB, MEAB, or
       MAB. For Consulting Services, the twelve-day period to complete the
       post-qualification process shall reckon from the completion of the
       negotiation with the Bidder that submitted the HRB. In exceptional
       cases, the post-qualification period may be extended by the HoPE, but
       in no case shall the aggregate period exceed forty-five (45) calendar
       days for Goods and Infrastructure Projects, or thirty (30) calendar days
       for Consulting Services.

       In case of post-disqualification of the bidder with the LCB, MEAB, MAB,
       or HRB, the BAC shall be given the same fresh period to conduct the
       post-qualification of the next LCB/MEAB/HRBLCB, MEAB, MAB, or
       HRB until a bidder is post-qualified or failure of bidding is declared
       based on Section 64 of this IRR.

Section 64. Failure of Bidding

64.1   There shall be a failure of bidding in competitive bidding, limited source
       bidding, or competitive dialogue, if:

       a) No bids are received;

       b) All bidders are declared ineligible;

       c) No bid qualifies as the SCRB, MARB, LCRB, HRRB, or MEARB; or

       d) Whenever the bidder with the SCRB, MARB, LCRB, HRRB, or
       MEARB, as the case may be, refuses, without justifiable cause, to
       accept the award of contract.

       For other modes of procurement that do not require competitive
       selection, the BAC may declare a failure of procurement in any of the
       above-mentioned instances or if negotiations fail, as may be necessary
       and applicable.


                                                                              118
64.2   In order to determine the reason for the failed bidding, the End-User or
       Implementing Unit shall conduct a mandatory review and evaluation of
       the terms, conditions, and specifications in the Bidding Documents,
       including its cost estimates.

64.3   Based on the End-User or Implementing Unit’s findings or evaluation,
       the BAC shall revise the terms, conditions, and specifications, and if
       necessary, adjust the ABC, subject to the required approvals, and
       conduct a re-bidding with re-publishing, as provided for in Section 50 of
       this IRR.

64.4   All bidders who have initially responded to the Invitation to Bid or
       Request for Expression of Interest and have been declared eligible or
       shortlisted in the previous biddings shall be allowed to submit new bids.
       The BAC shall observe the same process and set the new periods
       according to the same rules followed during the previous bidding(s).

64.5   Should a second failure of bidding occur, the Procuring Entity may
       resort to negotiated procurement as provided for in Section 35 of this
       IRR.


Section 65. Single Calculated/Rated/Economically Advantageous and
            Responsive Bid Submission

The Single Calculated Responsive Bid (SCRB), Single Rated Responsive Bid
(SRRB), Single Economically Advantageous Responsive Bid (SEARB), or
Single Advantageous Responsive Bid (SARB) as the case may be, shall be
considered for award if it falls under any of the following circumstances:

   a. If after publication, only one prospective bidder applies for eligibility
      check in accordance with the provisions of this IRR, and it meets the
      eligibility requirements or criteria, after which it submits a bid which is
      found to be responsive to the bidding requirements;

   b. If after publication, more than one prospective bidder applies for
      eligibility check in accordance with the provisions of this IRR, but only
      one bidder meets the eligibility requirements or criteria, after which it
      submits a bid which is found to be responsive to the bidding
      requirements; or

   c. If after the eligibility check, more than one bidder meets the eligibility
      requirements in accordance with the provisions of this IRR, but only one
      bidder submits a bid, and its bid is found to be responsive to the bidding
      requirements.

In all instances, the Procuring Entity shall ensure that the ABC reflects the
most advantageous prevailing price for the Government.



                                                                              119
                        RULE XI

       contract, shall not exceed sixty (60) calendar days. All members of the
       BAC, BAC Secretariat, TWG, and other relevant procurement personnel
       shall be on a “jury duty” type of assignment until the Notice of Award is
       issued by the HoPE in order to complete the entire procurement process
       at the earliest possible time.



                                                                               121
67.2 The GPPB is authorized to adjust the period as may be deemed
     appropriate: Provided, That the adjusted period shall not exceed ninety
     (90) calendar days.

67.3   The maximum periods and the recommended earliest possible time for
       action on specific procurement activities are provided for in this IRR. In
       case the deadline for each activity falls on a non-working day (i.e.,
       Saturday and Sunday), legal holiday, or special non-working holiday, or
       other nonworking days duly declared by the President, Governor, Mayor
       or other Government Official authorized to make such declaration, the
       deadline shall be the next working day.

       However, for purposes of expediency, economy, and efficiency, as
       determined by the BAC, specific procurement activities may be held on
       a Saturday, Sunday, non-working day, or holiday: Provided, That the
       BAC, Secretariat, and TWG members shall be available on such date,
       and the appropriate supplemental or bid bulletin is issued and posted
       pursuant to the posting requirements embodied in Section 51.5.3 of this
       IRR.

67.4   The period of action on procurement activities is tolled or suspended, as
       follows:

   a) For Early Procurement Activities, pending approval and effectivity of the
      GAA, corporate budget or appropriations ordinance, or the loan
      agreement in the case of FAPs; and

   b) During the suspension of the conduct of procurement activities, as
      determined by the BAC.

The period of action on procurement activities which has been tolled or
suspended shall begin to run again once the basis of such tolling or suspension
no longer exists, such as upon the approval and effectivity of the GAA,
reenacted budget, appropriations ordinance, corporate budget or loan
agreement, as the case may be, or upon lifting of the suspension of the conduct
of procurement activities.

The period of action on procurement activities shall not commence anew, but
rather, grant the Procuring Entity the balance of the remaining period available
for the conduct of procurement activities which has been tolled or suspended.

Section 68. Performance Security

To guarantee the faithful performance by the winning bidder of its obligations
under the contract in accordance with the Bidding Documents, it shall post a
performance security prior to the signing of the contract. The winning bidder is
required to update the performance security posted prior to the issuance of a
variation order or an amendment to order, if any.




                                                                             122
The IC shall maintain on its website an updated list of its accredited surety
companies that may be tapped to issue surety and/or performance bonds. The
list of surety companies identified by the IC shall include only those whose
surety business is ready to provide callable-on-demand surety contracts, where
the Procuring Entity can claim outright on the surety contract and receive the
proceeds thereof upon default of the bidder.

Sectors enumerated under Section 76 of this IRR may also be allowed to post
a Performance Securing Declaration (PSD) in lieu of a performance security.

The PSD shall state, among others, that the winning bidder shall be blacklisted
from being qualified to participate in any government procurement activity for
one (1) year, in case of the first offense, or two (2) years, if with a prior similar
offense, in the event that it violates any of the conditions stated in the contract.
An unnotarized PSD may be accepted, subject to submission of a notarized
PSD before any payment is made by the Procuring Entity, unless the same is
replaced with a performance security in the prescribed form, as stated above.

The performance security shall be in the form chosen by the Procuring Entity
and in the amount not less than the required percentage of the total contract
price in accordance with the following schedule:

                                                Amount of Performance
                                               Security (Not less than the
   Form of Performance Security
                                               required percentage of the
                                                     Total Contract)

 a) Cash or cashier’s or manager’s
 check issued by a Bank.

 For biddings conducted by LGUs, the
 cashier’s or manager’s check may be          Goods and Consulting
 issued by other banks certified by the       Services - Five percent (5%)
 BSP as authorized to issue such
 financial instrument.                        Infrastructure Projects – Ten
 b) Bank draft or guarantee or                percent (10%)
 irrevocable letter of credit issued by a
 bank. If issued by a foreign bank, it
 shall be confirmed or authenticated
 by a bank.
 c) Surety bond callable upon demand
 issued by a surety or insurance
 company duly certified by the                Thirty percent (30%)
 Insurance Commission as authorized
 to issue such security.

The performance security shall be denominated in Philippine Peso and posted
in favor of the Procuring Entity, which shall be forfeited in the event it is
established that the winning bidder is in default in any of its obligations under
the contract.


                                                                                 123
The winning Bidder shall ensure that the performance security remains
effective until the issuance of the Certificate of Final Acceptance. In case the
performance security issued is valid for a specific period shorter than the term
of the contract, the same shall be renewed or extended as often as necessary
and immediately submitted to the Procuring Entity.

The performance security may be released by the Procuring Entity after the
issuance of the Certificate of Final Acceptance; Provided, That the Procuring
Entity has no claims filed against the performance security.

For the procurement of Infrastructure Projects, the winning bidder shall post
an additional performance security following the schedule above to cover any
cumulative increase of more than ten percent (10%) over the original value of
the contract as a result of amendments to order or change orders, extra work
orders and supplemental agreements, as the case may be. The winning bidder
shall cause the extension of the validity of the performance security to cover
approved contract time extensions.

The Procuring Entity shall allow a proportional reduction in the original
performance security in the following cases:

   a) In case of a reduction in the contract value; or

   b) In case of procurement of Infrastructure Projects, for partially completed
      works under the contract which are usable and accepted by the
      Procuring Entity, and the use of which, in the judgment of the Procuring
      Entity, will not affect the structural integrity of the entire project.

Provided, that any reduction in the performance security is more than ten
percent (10%) and that the aggregate of such reductions is not more than fifty
percent (50%) of the performance security.

Section 69. Failure to Enter into Contract and Post Performance Security

69.1   If the bidder with the SCRB, SEARB, SARB, or SRRB fails, refuses or
       is unable to: (i) submit the documents required under Section 66.5 of
       this IRR; (ii) enter into contract with the Procuring Entity; or (iii) post the
       required performance security within the period stipulated in this IRR or
       in the Bidding Documents, the bidder shall be disqualified from further
       participating in the bidding process. Further, the bid security shall be
       forfeited, and the appropriate sanctions provided in this IRR and
       existing laws shall be imposed, except where such failure, refusal or
       inability is through no fault of the said bidder. Consequently, a failure of
       bidding shall be declared, and a rebidding of the procurement project
       shall be undertaken, if appropriate.

69.2   If the bidder with the LCRB, MEARB, MARB, or HRRB fails, refuses or
       is unable to: (i) submit the documents required under Section 66.5 of
       this IRR; (ii) enter into contract with the Procuring Entity; or (iii) post the


                                                                                   124
       required performance security within the period stipulated in this IRR or
       in the Bidding Documents, the bidder shall be disqualified from further
       participating in the bidding process. Further, the bid security shall be
       forfeited, and the appropriate sanctions provided in this IRR and
       existing laws shall be imposed, except where such failure, refusal or
       inability is through no fault of the said bidder.

Furthermore, the BAC shall disqualify the said bidder, and initiate and
complete the post-qualification process on the bidder with the second LCB,
MEAB, MAB, or HRB; Provided, however, That in the case of Consulting
Services, the second Highest Rated Bid has successfully undergone the
negotiation stage in accordance with Section 62 of this IRR. This procedure
shall be repeated until the LCRB, MEARB, MARB, or HRRB is determined for
award. However, if no bidder passes post-qualification, the BAC shall declare
the failure of bidding and conduct a re-bidding with re-publication, if
appropriate. Should another failure of bidding occur after the conduct of the re-
bidding, the Procuring Entity may enter into a negotiated procurement.

Section 70. Reservation Clause

The HoPE reserves the right to reject any and all bids, declare a failure of
bidding, or not award the contract in the following situations:

   a) If there is prima facie evidence of collusion between appropriate public
      officers or employees of the Procuring Entity, or between the BAC and
      any of the bidders, or if the collusion is between or among the bidders
      themselves, or between a bidder and a third party, including any act
      which restricts, suppresses or nullifies, or tends to restrict, suppress or
      nullify competition or influences or tends to influence the bidding
      process;

   b) If the BAC is found to have failed in complying with the applicable law
      or in following the prescribed bidding procedures; or

   c) For justifiable and reasonable grounds, where the award of contract will
      not redound to the benefit of the government in the following instances:
      (i) if the physical and economic conditions have significantly changed
      so as to render the project no longer economically, financially, or
      technically feasible, as determined by the HoPE; (ii) if the project is no
      longer necessary, as determined by the HoPE; or (iii) if the source of
      funds for the project has been withheld or reduced through no fault of
      the Procuring Entity.

Section 71. Contract Implementation and Termination

The rules for the implementation and termination of contracts awarded pursuant
to the provisions of the Act and its IRR are hereby prescribed, subject to
relevant provisions in the Manual to be issued by the GPPB.

Section 71.1 Contract Implementation for the Procurement of Goods


                                                                              125
71.1.1 Amendment to Order. – Amendments to Order for procurement of goods
       may be issued by the Procuring Entity concerned at any time after the
       contract execution, subject to the following conditions:

   a) Emergency cases, fortuitous events, or unforeseen contingencies
      arising during project or contract implementation, and such
      contingencies have an impact on the procurement at hand, such as i)
      changes in the conditions affecting the project (e.g., drawings, design or
      specifications, if the goods to be furnished are to be specifically
      manufactured for the Government in accordance therewith; method of
      shipment or packing; or place of delivery); ii) time is of the essence in
      the implementation of the project, and any changes require immediate
      implementation; iii) where there are additional items needed and
      necessary for the protection of the goods, such as changes in the
      packaging of the goods; or iv) other causes where immediate action is
      necessary to prevent damage to or loss of life or property;

   b) When the contract does not reflect the real intention of the parties due
      to mistake or accident, and the amendment is necessary to reflect the
      parties’ intention as provided in the procurement documents;

   c) When requested by the End-User or Implementing Unit, as may be
      prompted by a request from the supplier, the HoPE may approve the
      amendment of the delivery schedule based on meritorious grounds and
      without fault or negligence on the part of the supplier. The maximum
      allowable extension should not be longer than the initial delivery period;

   d) When the offered goods are no longer available, goods of equivalent or
      higher specifications may be accepted by the Procuring Entity; Provided;
      That there is no resulting increase in contract price and the acceptance
      of such goods is advantageous to the government; or

   e) Other analogous circumstances that could affect the conditions of the
      procurement at hand.

   If any such order increases or decreases the cost of, or the time required
   for executing any part of the contracted goods, supplies, or materials, an
   equitable adjustment in contract price and/or delivery schedule shall be
   mutually agreed upon between the parties, and the contract modified in
   writing; Provided, That any increase must not exceed ten percent (10%) of
   the original contract price. However, the HoPE may approve the increase to
   twenty percent (20%).

   Payment for additional items shall be based on the unit prices in the original
   contract. If the contract does not contain any rate applicable to the additional
   items, then suitable prices shall be mutually agreed upon between the
   parties.




                                                                               126
71.1.2 Suspension of Delivery of Goods

The Procuring Entity may suspend the delivery of Goods, in whole or in part,
through a written order for a specified period of time as it deems necessary
based on justifiable circumstances. Suspension order may be extended, as the
case may be, but not to exceed the original contract duration. However, for
meritorious reasons as determined by the HoPE, upon the recommendation of
the End-User or the Implementing Unit, the period for suspension may exceed
the original contract duration.

During such suspension, the supplier, manufacturer, or distributor shall take all
reasonable steps to minimize the costs related to storage and handling of
Goods, or other activities affected by the suspension order. Delivery of Goods
shall be understood to include installation, commissioning, and other relevant
services, as may be applicable.

Before the suspension order expires, the Procuring Entity concerned shall
either lift such order or terminate the delivery covered by the same. If the
suspension order is lifted, or if the period of the order expires, the Procuring
Entity shall notify the supplier, manufacturer, or distributor in writing of such
fact. The supplier, manufacturer, or distributor shall resume delivery upon
receipt of such notice.

71.1.3 Extension of Contract Time

Requests for extensions, whether initial or supplemental, shall be submitted
before the prescribed delivery date. The same may be approved by the HoPE
upon the recommendation of the End-User or Implementing Unit, based on
meritorious reasons.

71.1.4 Liquidated Damages

The supplier, manufacturer, or distributor shall deliver the goods procured
within the period as specified in the Contract.

Liquidated damages shall be imposed if any or all of the contracted Goods
remain undelivered on the specified date, including the duly granted extensions.

When the supplier, manufacturer, or distributor fails to satisfactorily deliver the
goods under the contract within the specified delivery schedule, inclusive of
duly granted time extensions, if any, the supplier, manufacturer, or distributor
shall be liable for liquidated damages in an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of
one percent (1%) of the cost of the delayed goods scheduled for delivery for
every day of delay until such goods are finally delivered and accepted by the
Procuring Entity. The Procuring Entity need not prove that it has incurred actual
damages to be entitled to liquidated damages. Such amount shall be deducted
from any money due, or which may become due the supplier, manufacturer, or
distributor, or collected from any securities or warranties posted by the supplier,
manufacturer, or distributor, whichever is convenient to the Procuring Entity. In
case the total sum of liquidated damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the total


                                                                               127
contract price, the Procuring Entity may rescind the contract and impose
appropriate sanctions over and above the liquidated damages to be paid.

If delays are likely to be incurred beyond its control, the supplier, manufacturer,
or distributor shall promptly notify the Procuring Entity in writing, providing
details of the causes and duration of the expected delay. The Procuring Entity
may, at its discretion, grant a time extension based on meritorious grounds,
with or without the imposition of liquidated damages.

71.1.5 Advance Payment

In accordance with existing rules, advance payments may be made as follows:

                  a) A single advance payment not to exceed fifty percent
                     (50%) of the contract amount shall be allowed for contracts
                     entered into by a procuring entity for the following services
                     where the requirement of down payment is a standard
                     industry practice: i) Hotel and restaurant services; ii) Use
                     of conference/seminar and exhibit areas; and iii) Lease of
                     office space.

                  b) Advance payment not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of
                     the contract amount, unless otherwise directed by the
                     President, shall also be allowed for procurement of goods
                     required to address contingencies arising from natural or
                     man-made calamities in areas where a “State of Calamity”
                     has been declared by appropriate authorities;

                  c) Upon submission of an irrevocable letter of credit or bank
                     guarantee issued by a Universal or Commercial Bank,
                     advance payment not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of
                     the contract amount shall be allowed and paid within sixty
                     (60) calendar days from the signing of the contract. The
                     irrevocable letter of credit or bank guarantee must be for
                     an equivalent amount, shall remain valid until the goods
                     are delivered, and accompanied by a claim for advance
                     payment.

              All progress payments shall first be charged against the advance
              payment until the latter has been fully exhausted.

              71.1.6 Other Aspects of Contract Implementation

              The rules and regulations for the other aspects of contract
              implementation shall be included in the manuals to be issued by
              the GPPB, such as, but not limited to, the following:

                  a) Incidental Services;
                  b) Spare Parts;
                  c) Delays in the Supplier’s Performance;


                                                                               128
                d)   Purchaser’s Responsibilities;
                e)   Prices;
                f)   Payment;
                g)   Taxes and Duties;
                h)   Subcontracts;
                i)   Standards;
                j)   Packing;
                k)   Insurance;
                l)   Transportation;

Section 71.2 Contract Implementation for the Procurement of Infrastructure
             Projects

            71.2.1 Variation Orders

            Variation Orders may be issued by the Procuring Entity to cover
            any increase or decrease in quantities, including the introduction
            of new work items that are not included in the original contract or
            reclassification of work items that are either due to change of
            plans, design or alignment to suit actual field conditions resulting
            in disparity between the preconstruction plans used for purposes
            of bidding and the "as staked plans" or construction drawings
            prepared after a joint survey by the contractor and the
            Government after award of the contract.

            Provided, That in case of positive or additive Variation Order/s,
            the cumulative amount thereof shall not exceed ten percent (10%)
            of the original contract price; Provided, further, That the scope of
            works shall not be reduced as to accommodate a positive
            Variation Order. In all cases, the addition of works under Variation
            Orders should be within the general scope of the project as bid
            and awarded.

            Any cumulative positive Variation Order beyond ten percent
            (10%) of the original contract price shall be the subject of another
            procurement project to be bid out if the works are separable from
            the original contract. In exceptional cases where it is urgently
            necessary to complete the original scope of work, the HoPE, upon
            the recommendation of the End-User or Implementing Unit, may
            authorize positive Variation Order/s resulting to a cumulative
            value of the positive Variation Orders beyond ten percent (10%)


                                                                            129
but not more than twenty percent (20%) of the original contract
price.

All progress payments shall first be charged against the advance
payment until the latter has been fully exhausted, at the option of
the Procuring Entity.

   a) Variation Order may either be in the form of either a
      Change Order or Extra Work Order

         i)   A Change Order may be issued by the HoPE or duly
              authorized representative to cover any increase or
              decrease in quantities of original work items in the
              contract.

        ii)   An Extra Work Order may be issued by the
              implementing official to cover the introduction of
              new work necessary for the completion,
              improvement or protection of the project which was
              not included as items of work in the original contract,
              such as, where there are subsurface or latent
              physical conditions at the site differing materially
              from those indicated in the contract, or where there
              are duly unknown physical conditions at the site of
              an unusual nature differing materially from those
              ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as
              inherent in the work or character provided for in the
              contract.

   b) Additional or Extra Work Costing

   For Variation Orders, the contractor shall be paid for additional
   work items whose unit prices shall be derived based on the
   following:

         i)   For additional or extra works duly covered by
              Change Orders involving work items which are
              exactly the same or similar to those in the original
              contract, the applicable unit prices of work items
              original contract shall be used.

        ii)   For additional or extra works duly covered by Extra
              Work Orders involving new work items that are not
              in the original contract, the unit prices of the new
              work items shall be based on the direct unit costs
              used in the original contract (e.g., unit cost of
              cement, rebars, form lumber, labor rate, equipment
              rental, etc.). All new components of the new work
              item shall be fixed prices; Provided, The same is
              acceptable to both the Government and the


                                                                 130
          contractor; Provided further, That the direct unit
          costs of new components shall be based on the
          contractor's estimate as validated by the Procuring
          Entity concerned via documented canvass in
          accordance with existing rules and regulations. The
          direct cost of the new work item shall then be
          combined with the mark-up factor (i.e., taxes and
          profit) used by the contractor in its bid to determine
          the unit price of the new work item.

c) Conditions under which the Contractor is to start work
   under Variation Orders and Receive Payments

   Under no circumstances shall a contractor proceed to
   commence work under any Change Order or Extra Work
   Order unless it has been approved by the HoPE or its duly
   authorized representative. However, under any of the
   following conditions, the Procuring Entity’s representative
   or Project Engineer may, subject to the availability of funds
   and within the limits of its delegated authority, allow the
   immediate start of work under any Change Order or Extra
   Work Order:

     i)   In the event of an emergency where the prosecution
          of the work is urgent to avoid detriment to public
          service, or damage to life and/or property; and/or

    ii)   When time is of the essence;

   Provided, however, That such approval is valid on work
   done up to the point where the cumulative increase in
   value of work on the project which has not yet been duly
   fully approved does not exceed five percent (5%) of the
   adjusted original contract price.

   Provided, further, That immediately after the start of work,
   the corresponding Change Order or Extra Work Order
   shall be prepared and submitted for approval in
   accordance with the abovementioned rules. Payments for
   works satisfactorily accomplished on any Change Order or
   Extra Work Order may be made only after approval of the
   same by the HoPE or its duly authorized representative.

   Provided, finally, That for a Change Order or Extra Work
   Order involving a cumulative amount exceeding five
   percent (5%) of the original contract price, no work thereon
   may be commenced unless said Change Order or Extra
   Work Order has been approved by the HoPE or its duly
   authorized representative.



                                                            131
71.2.2 Suspension of Work

The Procuring Entity shall have the authority to suspend the work
wholly or partly by written order for such period as may be
deemed necessary, due to force majeure or any fortuitous event
or for failure on the part of the contractor to correct bad conditions
which are unsafe for workers or for the general public, to carry out
valid orders given by the Procuring Entity or to perform any
provisions of the contract, or due to adjustment of plans to suit
field conditions as found necessary during construction. The
contractor shall immediately comply with such order to suspend
the work wholly or partly.

Meanwhile, the contractor or its duly authorized representative
shall have the right to suspend work operation on any or all
projects or activities along the critical path of activities after fifteen
(15) calendar days from the date of receipt of written notice from
the contractor to the district engineer, regional director,
consultant, or equivalent official, as the case may be, due to the
following:

   a) There exist right-of-way problems which prohibit the
      contractor from performing work in accordance with the
      approved construction schedule.

   b) Requisite construction plans which must be owner-
      furnished are not issued to the contractor precluding any
      work called for by such plans.

   c) Peace and order conditions that make it extremely
      dangerous, if not possible, to work. However, this condition
      must be certified in writing by the PNP station which has
      responsibility over the affected area and confirmed by the
      Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG)
      Regional Director.

   d) There was a failure on the part of the Procuring Entity to
      deliver government-furnished materials and equipment as
      stipulated in the contract.

   e) Delay in the payment of contractor's claim for progress
      billing beyond forty-five (45) calendar days from the time
      the contractor's claim has been certified by the Procuring
      Entity’s authorized representative that the documents are
      complete, unless there are justifiable reasons for the delay
      in payment which shall be communicated in writing to the
      contractor.

71.2.3 Extension of Contract Time



                                                                      132
Should the amount of additional work or other special
circumstances warrant the entitlement of the contractor to an
extension of contract time, the Procuring Entity shall determine
the amount of such extension; Provided, That the contractor has
notified the Procuring Entity of its claim for extension of contract
time prior to the expiration of the contract time, and within thirty
(30) calendar days after the additional work has been
commenced or the circumstances leading to such claim have
arisen, as the case may be, in order to give the Procuring Entity
the opportunity to investigate the claim. Failure to provide such
notice shall constitute a waiver of such a claim by the contractor.
Upon receipt of full and detailed particulars, the Procuring Entity
shall examine the facts and extent of the delay and shall extend
the contract time to complete the contract work when, in the
Procuring Entity's opinion, the findings of facts justify an
extension.

No extension of contract time shall be granted to the contractor
due to ordinary unfavorable weather conditions and inexcusable
negligence of the contractor to provide the required equipment,
supplies, or materials.

71.2.4 Liquidated Damages

When the contractor fails to satisfactorily complete the works
under the contract within the specified contract duration, inclusive
of duly granted time extensions, if any, the contractor shall be
liable for liquidated damages in an amount equal to at least one-
tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the cost of the unperformed
portion of the works for every day of delay.

In computing liquidated damages, the Procuring Entity shall
determine the usability of the project. A project or a portion thereof
may be deemed usable when it starts to provide the desired
benefits as certified by the targeted End-User or Implementing
Units and the Procuring Entity.

To be entitled to liquidated damages, the Procuring Entity does
not have to prove that it has incurred actual damages. Such
amount shall be deducted from any money due, or which may
become due the contractor under the contract, collected from the
retention money or other securities posted by the contractor, or a
combination thereof, whichever is convenient to the Procuring
Entity.

In case the total sum of liquidated damages reaches ten percent
(10%) of the total contract price, the Procuring Entity may rescind
or terminate the contract, without prejudice to other courses of
action and remedies available under the circumstances.



                                                                  133
71.2.5 Advance Payment

The Procuring Entity shall make an advance payment to the
contractor in an amount not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of
the total contract price to be made in lump sum or, at the most,
two installments according to a schedule specified in the
Instructions to Bidders and other relevant bidding documents.

The advance payment shall be made only upon:

   a) Written request of the contractor which shall form part of
      the contract document; and

   b) Submission of an irrevocable standby letter of credit of
      equivalent value from a bank as confirmed by the
      Procuring Entity; a bank guarantee; or a surety bond
      callable upon demand issued by a duly licensed surety or
      insurance company, at the option of the Procuring Entity.

71.2.6 Negative Slippage

The Procuring Entity shall ensure the timely implementation of
Infrastructure Projects by monitoring the performance of the
contractors. When the contractor incurs negative slippage during
the contract duration, the Procuring Entity shall implement the
calibrated measures to be provided in the guidelines issued by
the GPPB.

71.2.7 Progress Payment

Once a month, the contractor may submit a statement of work
accomplished (SWA) or progress billing and corresponding
request for progress payment for work accomplished. The SWA
should show the amounts which the contractor considers itself to
be entitled to up to the end of the month, to cover (i) the
cumulative value of the works it executed to date, based on the
items in the Bill of Quantities, and (ii) adjustments made for
approved Variation Orders executed. Alternatively, the Procuring
Entity may require in the Bidding Documents that the SWA or
progress billing and the corresponding request for progress
payment may only be submitted upon actual completion of the
Infrastructure Project or a specific portion, segment, milestone or
phase thereof.

The Procuring Entity’s representative or Project Engineer shall
check the contractor’s SWA and certify the amount to be paid to
the contractor as progress payment. Except as otherwise
stipulated in the Instruction to Bidders, materials and equipment
delivered on the site but not completely put in place shall not be
included for payment.


                                                               134
             The Procuring Entity shall deduct the following from the certified
             gross amounts to be paid to the contractor as progress payment:

                a) Cumulative value of the work previously certified and paid
                   for.
                b) Portion of the advance payment to be recouped.
                c) Retention money in accordance with the condition of the
                   contract.
                d) Amount to cover third-party liabilities.
                e) Amount to cover uncorrected discovered defects in the
                   works.

             71.2.8 Retention Money

             Progress payments are subject to retention of ten percent (10%)
             referred to as the retention money. Such retention shall be based
             on the total amount due to the contractor prior to any deduction
             and shall be retained from every progress payment until fifty
             percent (50%) of the value of works, as determined by the
             Procuring Entity, are completed. If, after fifty percent (50%)
             completion, the work is satisfactorily done and on schedule, no
             additional retention shall be made; otherwise, the ten percent
             (10%) retention shall be imposed, which may be decreased to 5
             percent (5%) by the Procuring Entity based on justifiable causes.

             The total retention money shall be due for release upon final
             acceptance of the works. The contractor may, however, request
             the substitution of the retention money for each progress billing
             with irrevocable standby letters of credit from a commercial bank,
             bank guarantees or surety bonds callable on demand, of amounts
             equivalent to the retention money substituted for and acceptable
             to Government; Provided, That the project is on schedule and is
             satisfactorily undertaken.

             71.2.9 Other Aspects of Contract Implementation

             The rules and regulations for the other aspects of contract
             implementation shall be included in the manuals to be issued by
             the GPPB, such as, but not limited to, the following:

                a)   Sub-contracting;
                b)   Interference with Traffic and Adjoining Properties;
                c)   Clearance of Project Site of Obstruction;
                d)   Inspection and Testing;
                e)   Daywork;
                f)   Measurement of Works; and
                g)   Other Implementation Aspects.

71.3 Contract Implementation for the Procurement of Consulting Services


                                                                           135
71.3.1 Contract Amendment

Changes to the consultancy contract affecting the project scope, key
personnel, schedule of deliverables and payments, timelines or contract
duration may be made if necessary to achieve the objectives of the
project.

In such cases, an equitable adjustment in contract price may be mutually
agreed upon by the Procuring Entity and the consultant in writing, using
similar rates or unit prices in the contract, or if not available, using
applicable or current rates and prices to cover the amended or additional
items in the consultancy contract; Provided, That the total increase in
cost does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the contract price.

71.3.2 Suspension of Work

Suspension of Work by the Procuring Entity

The Procuring Entity may, by written notice to the consultant, suspend
the work, including all payments to the consultant, if the consultant fails
to perform any of its obligations due to its own fault or due to force
majeure or other circumstances beyond the control of either party, e.g.
suspension of civil works being supervised by the consultant, under the
contract, including the carrying out of the services, provided that such
notice of suspension shall:

   a) Specify the nature of the failure; and
   b) Request the consultant to remedy such failure within a period not
      exceeding thirty (30) days after receipt by the consultant of such
      notice of suspension.

Prior to the expiration of the suspension order, the PMO, End-User, or
Implementing unit shall determine whether or not the grounds for
suspension still exist.

If the grounds for work suspension no longer exist and the continuation
of the work is practicable, the Procuring Entity can order the resumption
of work.

If such grounds continue to exist, or if it is no longer practicable to
continue with the work, it shall terminate the work subject of the order or
cancel the delivery of the items subject of such suspension.

If, however, the grounds for suspension no longer exist, and continuation
of the work is practicable, the PMO, with the approval of the HoPE or
his/her/them duly authorized representative, shall lift the suspension
order and notify the consultant to proceed with the work/delivery of items
in accordance with the amended contract.



                                                                       136
Suspension of Work by the Consultant

The consultant may, by written notice to the Procuring Entity, suspend
work on any or all activities affected by the following:

   a) Failure on the part of the Procuring Entity to deliver government-
      furnished equipment, resources, reports or data as stipulated in
      the contract;

   b) Peace and order conditions that make it extremely dangerous, if
      not impossible, to work, provided that the consultant secures a
      written certification from the PNP station that has responsibility
      over the affected area, as confirmed by the DILG Regional
      Director, that such conditions exist; or

   c) Delay in the payment of the consultant’s claim for progress billing
      beyond sixty (60) calendar days from the time the consultant’s
      claim has been certified by the Procuring Entity as being
      supported by complete documentation and a notice from the
      consultant has been received by the Procuring Entity that such
      payment is overdue, unless there are justifiable reasons which
      shall be communicated in writing to the consultants.

71.3.3 Extension or Adjustment of Contract Time

The adjustment or extension of contract time in consulting services shall
consider both the elapsed time between the effective order suspending
operation and the order to resume work in cases when the total
suspension or the suspension of activities along the critical path is not
due to the fault of the consultant.

71.3.4 Liquidated Damages

When the consultant fails to satisfactorily complete the services required
under the contract within the specified period, inclusive of duly granted
time extensions, if any, the consultant shall be liable for liquidated
damages in an amount equal to one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of
the cost of the unperformed portion for every day of delay.

In case the sum of liquidated damages reaches ten percent (10%) of the
contract amount, the contract may be rescinded or terminated by the
Procuring Entity, without prejudice to other courses of action and
remedies available under the circumstances. In case the contract is
rescinded or terminated, the Procuring Entity may take over the contract
or award the same to a qualified consultant through negotiated
procurement. In addition to the liquidated damages, the erring
consultant’s performance security shall also be forfeited.

In case the delay in the completion of the services exceeds ten percent
(10%) of the specified contract time plus any time extension duly granted


                                                                      137
       to the consultant, the Procuring Entity may rescind the contract. It then
       forfeits the consultant’s performance security and takes over the
       prosecution of the contract or awards the same to a qualified consultant
       through negotiated procurement.

       71.3.5 Other Aspects of Contract Implementation

       The rules and regulations for the other aspects of contract
       implementation shall be included in the manuals to be issued by the
       GPPB.

71.4   Termination of Contracts for the Procurement of Goods, Infrastructure
       Projects, and Consulting Services

       The policies relating to the whole or partial termination of government
       procurement contracts of Goods, Infrastructure Projects, and Consulting
       Services are herein established, subject to the manuals issued by the
       GPPB.

   71.4.1 Termination for Breach of Contract

          a) In contracts of Goods, the Procuring Entity may terminate for
             breach of contract when the Supplier fails to deliver or perform
             any or all of the Goods within the period(s) specified in the
             contract, or within any extension thereof granted by the Procuring
             Entity, pursuant to a request made by the supplier prior to the
             delay, and such failure amounts to at least ten percent (10%) of
             the contract price, consistent with the provision of this IRR on
             liquidated damages. The Procuring Entity may likewise impose
             appropriate sanctions therein.

          b) In contracts of Infrastructure Projects, the Procuring Entity shall
             terminate the contract for breach thereof when any of the
             following conditions are present:

                i)    Due to the Contractor’s fault and while the project is
                      ongoing, it has incurred negative slippage of fifteen
                      percent (15%) or more in accordance with Presidential
                      Decree 1870, s. 1983;

               ii)    Due to the contractor’s fault and after the contract time has
                      expired, it has incurred a negative slippage of ten percent
                      (10%) or more in the completion of the work;

               iii)   The contractor abandons the contract works, plainly
                      demonstrates an intention not to continue the performance
                      of the contractor’s obligations under the contract, refuses
                      or fails to comply with the Procuring Entity’s instructions,
                      or fails to proceed expeditiously and without delay despite
                      a written notice by the Procuring Entity;


                                                                               138
           iv)    When the contractor, without reasonable excuse, fails to
                  comply with the Notice of Rejection given by the Project
                  Engineer that, after examination therein, the Infrastructure
                  Project is found to be defective or otherwise not in
                  accordance with the Contract, or a Project Engineer’s
                  instruction to conduct remedial work, within 30 days after
                  receiving the said notice;

            v)    The contractor does not actually have on the project site
                  the minimum essential equipment listed on the Bid
                  necessary to prosecute the Works in accordance with the
                  approved work plan and equipment deployment schedule
                  as required for the project;

           vi)    The contractor does not execute the Works in accordance
                  with the contract or persistently or flagrantly neglects to
                  carry out its obligations under the contract;

          vii)    The contractor neglects or refuses to remove materials or
                  to perform a new work that has been rejected as defective
                  or unsuitable;

          viii)   The contractor subcontracts any part of the contract works
                  without approval by the Procuring Entity; or

           ix)    The contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent; goes into
                  liquidation, administration, reorganization, winding-up, or
                  dissolution; becomes subject to the appointment of a
                  liquidator, receiver, administrator, manager, or trustee;
                  enters into a composition or arrangement with the
                  contractor’s creditors; or any act is done or any event
                  occurs which is analogous to or has a similar effect to any
                  of these acts or events under applicable laws.

      c) In contracts for Consulting Services, the Procuring Entity may
         terminate for breach of contract when the consultant fails to
         deliver or perform the Outputs and Deliverables, within the period
         specified in the contract, or within any extension thereof granted
         by the Procuring Entity pursuant to a request made by the
         consultant prior to the delay, and such failure amounts to at least
         ten percent (10%) of the contract price, consistent with the
         provision of this IRR on liquidated damages. The Procuring Entity
         may likewise impose appropriate sanctions therein.

71.4.2 Termination due to Force Majeure

   a) In contracts for Goods, the Procuring Entity may terminate the
      contract and impose liquidated damages when, as a result of force
      majeure, the supplier is unable to deliver or perform any or all of the


                                                                          139
       Goods, amounting to at least ten percent (10%) of the contract price,
       for a period of not less than sixty (60) calendar days, or earlier, as
       deemed necessary by the Procuring Entity, after receipt of the written
       notice from the Procuring Entity stating that the circumstance of force
       majeure is deemed to have ceased.

   b) In contracts for Consulting Services, the consultant is unable to
      deliver or perform a material portion of the Outputs and Deliverables
      for a period of not less than sixty (60) calendar days, or earlier, as
      deemed necessary by the Procuring Entity, after receipt of the written
      notice from the Procuring Entity stating that the circumstance of force
      majeure is deemed to have ceased.

71.4.3 Termination for Procuring Entity’s Convenience

The Procuring Entity, by notice sent to the supplier, contractor, or
consultant, may terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, at any time, if it
has determined the existence of any of the following conditions that make
contract implementation economically, financially, or technically impractical
or unnecessary:

   a) In the case of Goods and Consulting Services

         i)    If physical and economic conditions have significantly
               changed so as to render the project no longer economically,
               financially, or technically feasible, as determined by the HoPE

        ii)    The HoPE has determined the existence of conditions that
               make project implementation impractical or unnecessary,
               such as, but not limited to, fortuitous event/s, changes in laws
               and government policies;

        iii)   Funding for the project has been withheld or reduced by higher
               authorities through no fault of the Procuring Entity; or

        iv)    Any circumstance analogous to the foregoing.

   b) In the case of Infrastructure Projects

         i)    If physical and economic conditions have significantly
               changed so as to render the project no longer economically,
               financially, or technically feasible, as determined by the HoPE;
               or

        ii)    The HoPE has determined the existence of conditions that
               make project implementation impractical or unnecessary,
               such as, but not limited to, fortuitous events, changes in laws
               and government policies.

                            RULE XII
          SUSTAINABLE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT



                                                                         143
Section 72. Sustainable Public Procurement

72.1   All Procuring Entities shall establish and implement a Sustainable Public
       Procurement (SPP) Program aimed at achieving value for money on a
       whole life cycle basis. This is designed not only to meet the specific
       needs of government agencies but also to create broader societal and
       economic benefits and reduce adverse environmental impacts.

72.2   The establishment of an SPP Program requires Procuring Entities to
       integrate sustainability considerations from procurement planning,
       budgeting to implementation, contract management, and disposal. This
       includes incorporating environmental, social, and economic criteria into
       procurement specifications, evaluations, and decisions.

       72.2.1 For the Environmental aspect, Goods, Services, and
              Infrastructure that minimize negative impacts must be
              prioritized.

       72.2.2 For the Social aspect, Procuring Entities must consider fair labor
              practices, respect human rights, promote gender equity,
              inclusivity, and support MSMEs, social enterprises,
              cooperatives, and other marginalized sectors.

72.3   The GPPB will issue guidelines on the necessary sustainability criteria,
       ensuring that all procurement activities align with these standards.

Section 73. Green Public Procurement Strategy

73.1 Green Public Procurement (GPP) is an approach whereby Procuring
     Entities seek to procure Goods, Infrastructure Projects, and Consulting
     Services with reduced environmental impact through their life cycle.

       As part of strategic procurement planning and in support of the
       Philippines' commitment to accelerate climate action and strengthen
       disaster resilience, Procuring Entities shall integrate and implement
       green practices, as well as environmentally relevant criteria or
       requirements in the design and specifications of their procurement
       projects.

        73.1.1 Environmental sustainability should be integrated from the
              outset, encompassing project identification, design, and budget
              preparation, to ensure that climate-resilient and environmentally
              advantageous solutions are prioritized throughout the
              procurement process.

               To further promote GPP, the sustainability of products,
               materials, or structures with green specifications shall be given
               greater weight in the evaluation of Bids, and in accordance with
               the Bidding Documents.



                                                                            144
73.2 During planning and design, based on impact assessment, Procuring
     Entities must apply criteria, such as energy efficiency, sustainable
     materials, and waste reduction. Green specifications should be included
     in technical and performance requirements for Goods, Infrastructure
     Projects, and Consulting Services, focusing on energy-efficient products,
     renewable or recyclable materials, and reduced greenhouse or carbon
     emissions, and pollutants in defining the type and objective of the project
     to be procured.

      73.2.1 Integrating green practices in procurement requires Procuring
            Entities to incorporate environmental considerations throughout
            the project life cycle.

      73.2.2 Specifications must also align with environmental standards and
             certifications, advancing sustainability goals in government
             procurement as identified in the guidelines issued by the GPPB.

     73.2.3 Procuring Entities shall assess environmental criteria and
           specifications related to a specific procurement project to be
           included in the preparation of bidding documents:

                 e) For Goods, technical considerations and criteria that
                    particularly deal with each item's or product's primary
                    impact on the environment are important for the
                    development of these green specifications, and applying
                    the LCA in accordance with Section 13 of this IRR; and

                 f) For Infrastructure Projects, integrate a requirement for
                    contractors to submit an Environmental Impact Statement
                    (EIA) as part of the procurement process, in accordance
                    with Sections 8.2.1 and 13 of this IRR, and Presidential
                    Decree No. 1096 or the Philippine Green Building Code.

   73.2.4 In conducting market scoping, the Procuring Entity shall consider the
           application of the GPP strategy in the design of specific procurement
           projects. The approach should be structured to define environmental
           criteria and select a suitable procurement method capable of
           encouraging a competitive market response, in accordance with the
           provisions of Section 10.4 of this IRR. Priority areas for market
           scoping may include, but are not limited to:

           a) The range of potential bidders interested in providing green
              market solutions;

           b) The current level of green business practices and maturity of the
              market;

           c) The potential for innovative or emerging technologies;




                                                                            145
             d) The level of influence of public spending in motivating the market
                to respond;

             e) The motivations driving the market and the challenges it faces in
                providing green solutions;

             f) The standards and tools required to define environmental criteria
                and verify performance; and

             g) Other public and private sector organizations that have
                procured green solutions within this sector, or plan to do so in
                future procurements, to explore collaboration opportunities.

73.3 In order to achieve the policy's overall objectives, public procurement will
     prioritize items and services that enhance energy, water, and material
     efficiency, waste reduction, and prevent pollution and emissions. This
     approach will help to reduce climate change, promote local and rural
     development, and enhance the sustainability of supply chains and
     infrastructure. Further, it aims to boost industrial productivity, innovation,
     and competitiveness while also encouraging inclusive business models, the
     creation of green jobs, and the shift to a circular economy.

73.4 Procuring Entities must monitor and report on the GPP Strategy's
     implementation on a regular basis, including providing yearly reports to the
     GPPB indicating the quantity and the value for money of procurements with
     environmental criteria. These reports will be used to continually improve the
     GPP framework, update environmental standards sets, create minimum
     obligatory environmental standards, and highlight the benefits of green
     procurement.

73.5 The GPPB shall ensure the incorporation and implementation of the
     concepts of sustainability and GPP in the activities of the government. The
     GPP strategy shall be implemented in phases, taking into account the
     readiness of both the government agencies as well as green product
     suppliers.

     In addition to the issuance of guidelines, the GPPB may, as deemed
     necessary, prescribe standard bidding documents, forms, and evaluation
     documents, if applicable, that reflect the sustainability principles and
     objectives of GPP, in accordance with this IRR.

 Section 74. Development of a Green Local Market

  74.1 The DTI, in consultation with relevant government agencies and the
       private sector, shall develop a cost-efficient program for the validation
       and certification of green products. This program aims to attract green
       investments and enhance competition within government procurement.

        74.1.1 The validation and certification program shall include, but not be
               limited to, the establishment of clear criteria for identifying green


                                                                                146
              products, ensuring compliance with recognized environmental
              standards, and facilitating the efficient and transparent
              certification process.

74.2 The program shall be designed to reduce the financial and administrative
      burden on businesses, especially MSMEs, by ensuring that the
      certification process is accessible, affordable, and aligned with
      international best practices in environmental sustainability.

 74.3 The DTI, in coordination with relevant agencies, shall regularly review
      and update the certification criteria to reflect advancements in
      environmental standards, technologies, and market trends, ensuring the
      program remains effective and competitive. Additionally, it shall maintain
      an up-to-date directory of green local vendors in the market.

Section 75. Inclusive Procurement Program

75.1 To provide equal opportunities to the vulnerable and marginalized sectors,
     as well as microenterprises, social enterprises, and startups in public
     procurement, Procuring Entities shall encourage active participation of
     registered sectors in all procurement activities, by giving weight to gender
     parity, ethnic equity, and other social factors by integrating marginalized
     groups and socially responsible enterprises into government
     procurement. This program shall likewise ensure that procurement
     practices contribute to poverty reduction and respect fundamental labor
     standards.

 75.2 During the strategic procurement planning stage, Procuring Entities shall
      prioritize measures with enhanced social impact when defining the type
      and objectives of the project to be procured, in accordance with Section
      7 of this IRR.

        75.2.1 In identifying its procurement requirements, the Procuring
              Entities should particularly consider accessibility and inclusivity,
              and explore options that meet these requirements while
              enhancing social impact;

        75.2.2 Procuring Entities shall evaluate the social impacts associated
              with a specific procurement project to inform the design of
              bidding documents by applying LCA, in accordance with Section
              13 of this IRR;

        75.2.3 In the conduct of market scoping and engagement activities, the
               Procuring Entities should identify opportunities to improve social
               impact and engage inclusive suppliers. These activities may
               include, but are not limited to, organizing supplier days,
               providing training for inclusive suppliers to submit unsolicited
               Bids, and active promotion;




                                                                              147
         75.2.4 Procuring Entities shall adopt Fit-for-Purpose and Proportional
               procurement approaches to encourage the participation of
               registered bidders from vulnerable and marginalized sectors,
               microenterprises, social enterprises, and startups. The
               measures to be adopted include, but are not limited to:

               a) Reserving a percentage of procurement opportunities for
                  inclusive suppliers;

               b) Streamlining bidding processes to reduce administrative
                  burdens and compliance costs; and

               c) Conducting Small Value Procurements to pilot inclusive
                  procurements, in accordance with Section 34 of this IRR.

 75.3 Social criteria may be incorporated into bidding documents as part of the
      supplier selection criteria, technical specifications, award criteria, or
      contract performance clauses. These social criteria may include, but are
      not limited to, the following:

         a) Adherence to fundamental labor standards and human rights;

         b) Promotion of local job creation or employment opportunities for
         vulnerable and marginalized groups;

         c) Provision of apprenticeship and training opportunities for individuals
         facing challenges in entering the workforce; and

         d) Other social and community benefits.

75.4 Procuring Entities are required and encouraged to conduct routine
     monitoring and evaluation of the inclusive procurement program's results,
     determining how much procurement possibilities can assist startups, social
     businesses, microenterprises, and vulnerable sectors.

75.5 Procuring Entities shall identify inclusive procurement projects in their
     indicative APP aligned with Section 7.7.3 of this IRR, to give advanced
     notice to the market of the forthcoming opportunities.

75.6 Procuring Entities shall provide the GPPB with yearly reports that include
     information on how these sectors participated in their procurement
     activities, including a breakdown of contracts awarded, gender parity
     attained, and compliance with social responsibility standards. These
     reports will be utilized to improve the inclusive procurement framework and
     further refine policies.

75.7 The GPPB will issue guidelines, in consultation with relevant agencies, on
     gender-responsive public procurement covering Goods, Infrastructure
     Projects, or Consulting Services. These guidelines shall prioritize women-



                                                                              148
    led or women-owned businesses by ensuring their meaningful and active
    participation in public procurement and government contracting.

       Philippines substantially from articles, materials, or supplies of the
       growth, production, or manufacture, as the case may be, of the
       Philippines.

79.3   After the ten (10) year period counted from the effectivity of R.A
       No. 11981, the domestic preference shall be subject to a margin of
       preference to be determined by the Tatak Pinoy Council which shall not
       be lower than fifteen percent (15%).

79.4   For products and services governed by the TPS, the domestic
       preference in procurement shall be in accordance with the IRR or
       guidelines issued for the Tatak Pinoy Act.

79.5   The Procuring Entity shall award to the domestic bidder if the bid is not
       more than twenty-five percent (25%) in excess of the lowest foreign bid.
       The margin of preference provided herein shall be subject to a periodic
       review and adjustment by the GPPB, as may be necessary.

79.6   A Domestic Bidder can only claim preference if it secures from the
       appropriate agency a certification that the articles forming part of its bid
       are substantially composed of articles, materials, or supplies grown,
       produced, or manufactured in the Philippines.

79.7 The preference herein established may be waived should any of the
   following conditions be present:



                                                                               150
       a) Where domestic production is insufficient or unavailable in the
          required commercial quantities;

       b) Where the specific or desired quality is not met;

       c) Where domestic preference will result in inconsistencies with the
          Philippines' obligations under treaty or international or executive
          agreements; or

       d) Other analogous circumstances.


                              RULE XIV
                    LEASE OF MOVABLE PROPERTIES

Section 80. Lease Contracts

The lease of movable properties shall also be subject to government
procurement using the most applicable mode of procurement. Movable
properties refer to those properties defined under Articles 416, 417, and 418 of
the New Civil Code of the Philippines.


                                RULE XV
                        DISCLOSURE OF RELATIONS

Section 81. Disclosure of Relations

81.1   All bids shall be accompanied by a sworn affidavit of the bidder that it is
       not related to the HoPE, Procurement Agent if engaged, members of the
       BAC, the TWG, the BAC Secretariat, the head of the PMO or the End-
       User or Implementing Unit, and the project consultants, by consanguinity
       or affinity up to the third civil degree. The bidder shall also disclose the
       ultimate beneficial ownership of an entity. Failure to comply with the
       aforementioned provision shall be a ground for the automatic
       disqualification of the bid in consonance with Section 59 of this IRR. For
       this reason, relation to the aforementioned persons within the third civil
       degree of consanguinity or affinity shall automatically disqualify the
       bidder from participating in the procurement of contracts of the Procuring
       Entity notwithstanding the act of such persons inhibiting themselves from
       the procurement process. This provision shall apply to the following
       persons and affiliates:

       a) In the case of individuals or sole proprietorships, to the bidders and
          their spouses;

       b) In the case of partnerships, to the partnership itself and its partners;

       c) In the case of cooperatives, to the cooperative itself and members of
          the board of directors, general manager or chief executive officer;


                                                                               151
       d) A partnership, joint venture or consortium which is blacklisted or
          which has blacklisted member/s or partner/s as well as a person or
          entity who is a member of a blacklisted joint venture or consortium
          are, likewise, not allowed to participate in any government
          procurement during the period of suspension or blacklisting; and

       e) In the case of corporations, a single stockholder, together with their
          relatives up to the third civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, and
          their assignees, holding at least twenty percent (20%) of the shares
          therein, its chairman and president, shall be blacklisted after they
          have been determined to hold the same controlling interest in a
          previously blacklisted corporation or in two corporations that have
          been blacklisted; the corporations of which they are part shall also be
          blacklisted.

81.2   All bidders also found to have conflicting interests with each other shall
       be disqualified to participate in the procurement at hand, without
       prejudice to the imposition of appropriate administrative, civil, and
       criminal sanctions. A bidder may be considered to have conflicting
       interests with another bidder in any of the events described in
       paragraphs (a) through (c) below and a general conflict of interest in any
       of the circumstances set out in paragraphs (d) through (i) below:

       a) A bidder has controlling shareholders or beneficial owners in
          common with another bidder;

       b) A bidder receives or has received any direct or indirect subsidy from
          any other bidder;

       c) A bidder has the same legally authorized representative as that of
          another bidder for purposes of this bid;

       d) A bidder has a relationship, directly or through third parties, that puts
          them in a position to have access to information about or influence
          the bid of another bidder or influence the decisions of the Procuring
          Entity regarding this bidding process. This will include a firm or an
          organization that lends, or temporarily seconds, its personnel to firms
          or organizations that are engaged in consulting services for the
          preparation related to procurement for or implementation of the
          project if the personnel would be involved in any capacity on the
          same project;

       e) A bidder who participated as a consultant in the preparation of the
          design or technical specifications of the Goods and related services
          that are the subject of the bid;

       f) A bidder who lends, or temporarily seconds, its personnel to firms or
          organizations which are engaged in consulting services for the
          preparation related to procurement for or implementation of the


                                                                               152
          project, if the personnel would be involved in any capacity on the
          same project;

       g) If a consultant combines the function of consulting with those of
          contracting or supply of equipment;

       h) If a consultant is associated with, affiliated to, or owned by a
          contractor or a manufacturing firm with departments or design offices
          offering services as consultants unless such consultant includes
          relevant information on such relationships along with a statement in
          the technical proposal cover letter to the effect that the consultant
          shall limit its role to that of a consultant and disqualify itself and its
          associates from work in any other capacity that may emerge from the
          project, including bidding for any part of the future project. The
          contract with the consultant selected to undertake the project shall
          contain an appropriate provision to such effect; or

       i) If there is a conflict among consulting projects, the consultant,
          including its personnel and subcontractors, and any subsidiaries or
          entities controlled by such consultant shall not be recruited for the
          relevant project. The duties of the consultant depend on the
          circumstances of each case. While continuity of consulting services
          may be appropriate in particular situations where no conflict exists, a
          consultant cannot be recruited to carry out a project that, by its
          nature, shall result in conflict with a prior or current project of such
          consultant. Examples of the situations mentioned are when a
          consultant engaged to prepare engineering design for an
          infrastructure project shall not be recruited to prepare an independent
          environmental assessment for the same project; similarly, a
          consultant assisting a Procuring Entity in the privatization of public
          assets shall not purchase, nor advise purchasers, of such assets; or
          a consultant hired to prepare terms of reference for a project shall not
          be recruited for the project in question.

Section 82. Declaration of Beneficial Ownership

82.1   Legal entities like corporations, partnerships, private sector
       organizations, foundations, and associations that participate in
       procurement projects shall safeguard the government from all acts that
       undermine a transparent, fair, and competitive procurement process.
       The beneficial ownership information of the suppliers, manufacturers,
       distributors, contractors, or consultants, which shall be identified by the
       GPPB, shall be a requirement to participate in government procurement,
       specifically: Competitive Bidding, Limited Source Bidding, Competitive
       Dialogue, or Unsolicited Offer with Bid Matching.

82.2   The GPPB shall maintain an online registry of beneficial ownership
       information of bidders established for government procurement which
       shall be accessible to the public.



                                                                                153
82.3    The Bidder shall ensure that all beneficial ownership information is
        updated as often as may be necessary through the beneficial ownership
        registry.


                                  RULE XVI
                             PROTEST MECHANISM

Section 83. Protests on Decisions of the BAC

Decisions of the BAC in all stages of procurement may be protested to the
HoPE; Provided, That a prior request for reconsideration should have been filed
by the party concerned to the BAC and the same has been resolved.

83.1    The bidder may file a request for reconsideration to the BAC within three
        (3) calendar days upon receipt of written notice or upon verbal
        notification of the BAC decision. The BAC shall decide on the request
        for reconsideration within seven (7) calendar days from receipt thereof.
        The bidder shall not be allowed to submit additional documents to correct
        any defects in the bid submitted.

        If a failed bidder signifies its intent to file a request for reconsideration,
        the BAC shall keep the bid envelopes of the said failed bidder unopened
        and/or duly sealed until such time that the request for reconsideration
        has been resolved.

83.2    In the event that the request for reconsideration is denied, decisions of
        the BAC may be protested to the HoPE within seven (7) calendar days
        from receipt by the party concerned of the resolution of the BAC denying
        its request for reconsideration. The protest shall be made by
        electronically filing a verified position paper with the HoPE concerned,
        accompanied by the payment of a non-refundable protest fee, which
        shall be paid via electronic payment channels in accordance with the
        following schedule:

                       ABC Range                              Protest Fee
         P50 million and below                            0.75% of the ABC
         More than P50 million to P100 million            P500,000.00
         More than P100 million to P500 million           0.5% of the ABC
         More than P500 million to P1 billion             P2,500,000.00
         More than P1 billion to P2 billion               0.25% of the ABC
         More than P2 billion                             P5,000,000.00

83.3 The verified position paper shall contain the following information:

   a)   Name of the bidder;
   b)   Office address of the bidder;
   c)   Name of project or contract;
   d)   Implementing office or agency or Procuring Entity;


                                                                                  154
   e)   Brief statement of facts;
   f)   Issue to be resolved;
   g)   Factual basis and legal arguments in support of the protest; and
   h)   Such other matters and information pertinent and relevant to the proper
        resolution of the protest.

The position paper shall be verified by an affidavit that the affiant has read and
understood the contents thereof and that the allegations therein are true and
correct based on its personal knowledge or based on authentic records. An
unverified position paper shall be considered unsigned, produces no legal
effect, and results in the outright dismissal of the protest.

In addition, the bidder shall likewise certify under oath that:

   a) It has not previously commenced any action or filed any claim involving
      the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to
      the best of its knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending
      therein;

   b) If there is such other pending action or claim, the bidder is providing a
      complete statement of the present status thereof; and

   c) If it should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has
      been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days
      therefrom to the HoPE wherein its protest is filed.

Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere
amendment of the verified position paper.

For this purpose, the GPPB shall establish an electronic filing system which
shall cover the process from request for reconsideration to the resolution of the
protest. The procedures for the use of the electronic filing system shall be
provided for in the Guidelines issued by the GPPB.

Section 84. Resolution of Protests

The protests shall be resolved strictly on the basis of records of the BAC.

84.1    The HoPE shall resolve the protest within seven (7) calendar days from
        receipt thereof. Subject to the provisions of existing laws on the authority
        of Department Secretaries and the heads of agencies, branches,
        constitutional commissions, or instrumentalities of the GoP to approve
        contracts, the decisions of the HoPE concerned shall be final up to the
        limit of its contract approving authority. With respect to LGUs, the
        decision of the local chief executive shall be final.

        The decision of the HoPE shall clearly state the factual and legal bases
        used to resolve the protest and expressly cite relevant portions of the
        procurement or bidding documents, BAC resolutions, or other relevant
        documents used as references.


                                                                                155
84.2   The decision of the HoPE shall be final and executory for the following
       procurement projects:

   a) Procurement of Goods amounting to Twenty Million Pesos
      (₱20,000,000.00) and below;
   b) Procurement of infrastructure projects amounting to Fifty Million Pesos
      (₱50,000,000.00) and below; and
   c) Procurement of Consulting Services amounting to Ten Million Pesos
      (₱10,000,000.00) and below.

84.3   In case of LGUs, the decision of the HoPE shall be final and executory
       for the following procurement projects:

       a) Procurement of Goods amounting to One Million Two Hundred Fifty
          Thousand Pesos (₱1,250,000.00) and below;
       b) Procurement of infrastructure projects amounting to Twelve Million
          Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (₱12,500,000.00) and below; and
       c) Procurement of Consulting Services amounting to Two Million Five
          Hundred Thousand Pesos (₱2,500,000.00) and below.

Section 85. Resort to Regular Courts

Court action may be resorted to only after the protests contemplated in this
Article have been completed. Cases filed in violation of the process specified in
Article shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

The Regional Trial Court shall have jurisdiction over final decisions of the HoPE.
Court actions shall be governed by Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure, as amended.

In cases where the amounts are in excess of the specified thresholds in the
IRR, the decisions of the HoPE shall become final and executory ten (10)
calendar days after receipt of a copy thereof by the parties, unless, within the
same period, an appeal to the Regional Trial Court has been perfected.

Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to prejudice or prohibit the Office of the
Ombudsman from exercising its duties, functions, and powers as provided
under the 1987 Constitution, Republic Act No. 6770, otherwise known as the
"Ombudsman Act of 1989," and/or any relevant rules and regulations pursuant
thereto.

Section 86. Non-interruption of the Bidding Process

In no case shall any protest taken from any decision stay or delay the bidding
process; Provided, however, That protests must first be resolved before any
award is made.
.
Section 87. Prohibition on the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders,
Preliminary Mandatory Injunctions.


                                                                               156
No court, except the Supreme Court, shall issue any temporary restraining
order, preliminary injunction, or preliminary mandatory injunction against the
government or any of its subdivisions, officials, or any person or entity, whether
public or private, acting under the government direction, to restrain, prohibit, or
compel the procurement, bidding, or awarding of contracts for Goods,
Infrastructure Projects, and Consulting Services of the government;
commencement, execution, implementation, operation of any such contract;
termination or rescission of any such contract; and the undertaking or
authorization of any other lawful activity necessary for such contract.

This prohibition shall apply in all cases, disputes, or controversies instituted by
a party, including, but not limited to, cases filed by bidders or those claiming to
have rights through such bidders involving such contract. This prohibition shall
not apply when the matter is of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue,
such that unless a temporary restraining order is issued, grave injustice and
irreparable injury will arise. The applicant shall file a bond, in an amount to be
fixed by the court, which shall accrue in favor of the government should the
court finally decide that the applicant was not entitled to the relief sought.


                                RULE XVII
                         SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

Section 88. Dispute Resolution

88.1   Any dispute arising from the implementation of a contract covered by the
       Act and this IRR shall first be resolved and settled amicably by mutual
       consultation or agreement.

88.2   To ensure efficiency in the procurement process, parties to the dispute
       are encouraged to select the most expeditious mode of dispute
       resolution. The process of arbitration may be incorporated as a provision
       in the contract that will be executed pursuant to the provisions of the Act
       and this IRR; Provided, further, That by mutual agreement, the parties
       may agree in writing to resort to other alternative modes of dispute
       resolution.

88.3   In case of disagreement or after exhausting the remedies provided in the
       preceding Section, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration or other
       forms of alternative dispute resolution which includes mediation,
       conciliation, early neutral evaluation, mini-trial, or any combination
       thereof in accordance with the provisions of RA No. 9285, otherwise
       known as the “Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004”; Provided,
       however, That disputes that are within the competence and jurisdiction
       of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission to resolve shall be
       referred thereto.


                                   RULE XVIII


                                                                               157
                  CONTRACT PRICES AND WARRANTIES

Section 89. Contract Prices

For the given scope of work in the contract as awarded, all bid prices shall be
considered as fixed prices, and therefore not subject to price escalation during
contract implementation. In the event of an extraordinary increase in prices of
specific components of the Infrastructure Project, price escalation may be
considered, subject to prior approval of the GPPB. If the cost of construction
components increases by more than ten percent (10%) of the unit price of work
items, as determined against the prevailing price indices of the PSA, a price
escalation may be authorized at a no-loss, no-gain basis, using the appropriate
formula prescribed by the GPPB. For the purpose of this Section, the PSA shall
ensure that its price indices are region-specific and updated on a monthly basis.

The rules and regulations for price escalation, including its appropriate formula,
shall be included in the Guidelines to be issued by the GPPB.

Section 90. Warranty

90.1   For the procurement of Goods, in order to assure that manufacturing
       defects shall be corrected by the supplier, a warranty security shall be
       required from the contract awardee for a minimum period of three (3)
       months, in the case of Expendable Supplies, or a minimum period of one
       (1) year, in the case of Non-expendable Supplies, after acceptance by
       the Procuring Entity of the delivered supplies.

       The obligation for the warranty shall be covered by either retention
       money in an amount equivalent to at least one percent (1%) but not to
       exceed five percent (5%) of every progress payment, or a special bank
       guarantee equivalent to at least one percent (1%) but not to exceed five
       percent (5%) of the total contract price. The said amounts shall be
       automatically released by the Procuring Entity after the lapse of the
       warranty period or, in the case of Expendable Supplies, after
       consumption thereof; Provided, however, That the supplies delivered are
       free from patent and latent defects and all the conditions imposed under
       the contract have been fully met.

       In the absence of a specified retention money or special bank guarantee
       percentage within the Bidding Documents or Technical Requirements, a
       default warranty rate of one percent (1%) of the total contract price shall
       be applied.

90.2   For the procurement of Infrastructure Projects, the following warranties
       shall be made:

90.2.1 From the time project construction commenced up to final acceptance,
       the contractor shall assume full responsibility for the following:




                                                                              158
      a) Any damage or destruction of the works except those occasioned by
         force majeure; and

      b) Safety, protection, security, and convenience of its personnel, third
         parties, and the public at large, as well as the works, equipment,
         installation and the like to be affected by its construction work.

90.2.2 One (1) year from project completion up to final acceptance or the
       defects liability period:

      a) The contractor shall undertake the repair works, at its own expense,
         of any damage to the infrastructure on account of the use of materials
         of inferior quality, defects in the construction, or due to any violation
         of the terms of the contract, within ninety (90) calendar days from the
         time the HoPE has issued an order to undertake repair. In case of
         failure or refusal to comply with this mandate, the Procuring Entity
         shall undertake such repair works and shall be entitled to full
         reimbursement of expenses incurred therein upon demand.

      b) The defects liability period shall be covered by the performance
         security of the contractor required in Section 68 of this IRR, which
         shall guarantee that the contractor performs its responsibilities stated
         in the immediately preceding Section. If the contractor fails to comply
         with its obligations under Section 90.2.2 (a) of this IRR, the Procuring
         Entity shall forfeit its performance security, subject its properties to
         attachment or garnishment proceedings, and may impose the
         appropriate penalty under Sections 99, 100, and 101 of this IRR. All
         payables of the GoP in its favor shall be offset to recover the costs.

90.2.3 The following guidelines for Structural Defects shall cover the persons
       liable and their corresponding periods of liability:

   a) The following persons shall be held responsible for “Structural Defects,”
      i.e., major faults or flaws or deficiencies in one or more key structural
      elements of the project which may lead to structural failure of the
      completed elements or structure, or “Structural Failures,” i.e., where one
      or more key structural elements in an infrastructure facility fails or

                                                                             169
Section 102. Suspension of Bidder Pending Blacklisting Proceedings

During the pendency of the blacklisting proceedings, the bidder shall be
automatically suspended from participating in the current procurement activity
being undertaken by the Procuring Entity concerned.

The notice of the commencement of the blacklisting proceedings to the bidder
shall likewise serve as the suspension order.

The dismissal of the case by the HoPE shall result in the automatic lifting of the
suspension order.

Section 103. Status of Suspended or Blacklisted Bidder

Before the issuance of a blacklisting order, the erring bidder may participate in
the procurement of any government project except in the Procuring Entity
where it is suspended: Provided, That if the blacklisting order is issued prior to
the date of the Notice of Award, the blacklisted bidder shall not be qualified for
award and such contract shall be awarded to another bidder.

The issuance of a suspension or blacklisting order shall not prejudice any
contract awarded prior thereto; Provided, That the offenses which brought
about the suspension or blacklisting are not connected to the awarded contract.

In case the penalty of suspension or blacklisting is imposed during the
pendency of a previous penalty, the latter shall be deemed terminated and
subsumed in the former.

Section 104. Initiation of Action; Subsequent Procedure

The BAC or the HoPE may, motu proprio, commence the administrative
proceedings for corrective measures, suspension or blacklisting, at any stage
of the procurement or contract implementation, upon prima facie determination
that a bidder or prospective bidder has committed any of the grounds provided
for in Sections 99, 100, and 101 of this IRR. Any bidder or prospective bidder
may also initiate the suspension and blacklisting proceedings.

At the option of the Procuring Entities, a reasonable fee may be required for
initiating the suspension and blacklisting proceedings.

104.1 The administrative proceedings for suspension and blacklisting shall
      cover the following, among others:

   a) Notice and Hearing – Upon initiation of action, the BAC shall
      immediately notify the bidder or prospective bidder concerned in writing,
      advising of its opportunity to show cause why it should not be held
      administratively liable, and to request, if preferred, for the conduct of a
      hearing before the BAC.




                                                                              170
       Upon evaluation of the records and if the BAC is convinced by
       substantial evidence that the bidder or prospective bidder is at fault, it
       shall issue a resolution recommending to the HoPE the imposition of
       administrative penalties.

   b) Decision – The HoPE shall, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the
      relevant BAC resolution, determine whether substantial evidence exists
      to support a finding of guilt in the administrative case. Otherwise, the
      HoPE shall dismiss the action.

       Decisions of the HoPE shall become final after seven (7) days from
       receipt thereof by the suspended or blacklisted bidder or prospective
       bidder, as the case may be, if no Request for Reconsideration is filed.

   c) Request for Reconsideration – A Request for Reconsideration may be
      filed by the suspended or blacklisted bidder or prospective bidder within
      three (3) calendar days from receipt of the notice of decision. The HoPE
      shall resolve the request for reconsideration within seven (7) calendar
      days from the filing thereof and furnish the suspended or blacklisted
      bidder or prospective bidder with a copy of the resolution immediately
      from its promulgation. Only one (1) request for reconsideration shall be
      allowed.

   d) Posting in the GPPB Portal – It is the responsibility of the Procuring
      Entity to upload a copy of the suspension or blacklisting order to the
      portal of the GPPB, within seven (7) calendar days from the issuance of
      the order.

Section 105. Extent of Administrative Sanctions

The penalties of suspension and blacklisting shall be applied against (i) any
entity in which the suspended or blacklisted person has a controlling interest;
and (ii) any beneficial owner of the suspended entity or blacklisted person.

The penalties shall also be applied against the following entities:

   a) In the case of individuals or sole proprietorships, to the bidders and their
      spouses;

   b) In the case of partnerships, to the partnership itself and its partners;

   c) In the case of cooperatives, to the cooperative itself and members of the
      board of directors, general manager or chief executive officer;

   d) A partnership, joint venture or consortium which is blacklisted or which
      has blacklisted member/s and/or partner/s as well as a person or entity
      who is a member of a blacklisted joint venture or consortium are,
      likewise, not allowed to participate in any government procurement
      during the period of suspension or blacklisting; and



                                                                                 171
   e) In the case of corporations, a single stockholder, together with their
      relatives up to the third civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, and their
      assignees, holding at least twenty percent (20%) of the shares therein,
      its chairperson and president, shall be blacklisted after they have been
      determined to hold the same controlling interest in a previously
      blacklisted corporation or in two corporations which have been
      blacklisted; the corporations of which they are part shall also be
      blacklisted.

105.1 Blacklisting Due to Enforcement of a Bid or Performance Securing
      Declaration

In addition to the forfeiture of the bid security or the performance security posted
by the private entity, the following provisions shall be observed in the imposition
of administrative penalties pursuant to the enforcement of the Bid Securing
Declaration Form (BSDF) or the Performance Securing Declaration Form
(PSDF):

The HoPE, upon recommendation of the BAC, shall immediately issue the
blacklisting or suspension order upon determination of the grounds for
enforcement and forfeiture of the BSDF or the PSDF.

A request for reconsideration may be filed with the HoPE within three (3)
calendar days from receipt of the blacklisting or suspension order.

105.2 Other Aspects of Suspension and Blacklisting

The procedures and other aspects relative to administrative proceedings for
corrective measures, suspension, and blacklisting of suppliers, contractors, or
consultants shall be undertaken in accordance with the guidelines to be issued
by the GPPB.
